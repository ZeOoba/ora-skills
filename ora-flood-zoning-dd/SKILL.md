## Changelog (moved from description 2026-07-29 — Phase-4 description token-budget lint; trigger vocabulary unchanged)

v1.4 (2026-08-24: Step 6A added - Planned Development (PD/PUD) parcels carry no by-right use table; run the minor-vs-major amendment tier test and capture the post-closing change-of-use trigger) · v1.3 (2026-07-24: mandatory geocode-vs-parcel validation added after a confirmed off-parcel geocode/empty-zoning-result incident; endpoints verified 2026-06-09; batch-write safety rule added 2026-07-12; cross-linked county-parcel-screen's endpoint registry for parcel-geometry lookups 2026-07-20)

# ORA Flood & Zoning DD-Critical Resolution

Purpose: convert "FEMA UNK" and "zoning UNK" into sourced determinations at SCREEN stage. Under Buy Box v1.0, any unresolved DD-Critical item caps a deal at T2 WATCH — resolving these two is usually the cheapest score unlock.

## Decision rules (Buy Box v1.0, ratified 2026-06-09)
- SFHA (Zone A/AE/AH/AO/VE) on the **building pad** = GATE KILL.
- SFHA on **excess land only** = proceed; land valued at **$0 in the basis test until FEMA determination is verified** (then re-credit and re-score — report both as a band, e.g., "58 → 71 if dry").
- Zone X (shaded/unshaded) = no flood constraint; record panel + effective date anyway.
- Zoning at screen = GIS designation + permitted-use check vs the municipal code. A **formal municipal zoning letter remains mandatory pre-LOI** — this skill does not substitute for it.
- **PD/PUD is not a use answer (added v1.4).** Where the GIS returns a planned-development designation, the code carries no by-right use table and an empty permitted-use lookup is a **FALSE NEGATIVE, not an UNK** — the governing instrument is the approved PD plan and its agreement, held by the planning department. Run **Step 6A**: obtain the plan, and get the minor-vs-major amendment tier for any intended site change in writing from a named official.
- NEVER assert flood or zoning status without a named source and date. If every tier fails, report UNVERIFIED explicitly.
- **Never write determinations into the source master in place (added v1.1, 2026-07-12).** When this skill's determinations are applied to an off-market/DD master workbook at batch scale (not a single ad hoc lookup), the writing script must load the CURRENT master, copy it to a NEW version (`YYYYMMDD_[Name]_v##.xlsx`) FIRST, and write all updates only to that copy — never `wb.save()` back onto the path it loaded from. Mirrors `parcel-data-recovery` Iron rule 6 (versioning) and Iron rule 2 (never overwrite shipped data). Precedent: 2026-07-12 Cincinnati/Hamilton-Butler-Clermont-Warren auto-DD flood pass (101 T2-QUEUE rows) wrote its DD-Critical updates directly into `v05` in place — caught after the fact, remediated by hand-copying to `v06`, no data lost, but the deviation should never have been possible. Any batch flood/zoning automation script must copy-then-write from the first line.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Geocode the parcel, then VALIDATE it against parcel geometry (mandatory — added v1.3)
Census geocoder (free, no key):
`https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/locations/onelineaddress?address={URL-ENCODED ADDRESS}&benchmark=Public_AR_Current&format=json`
Take lon/lat from `result.addressMatches[0].coordinates` (x=lon, y=lat).

**This point is an interpolation, not the parcel — do not feed it to Step 2 or Step 6 until validated.** The Census geocoder places the address by interpolating along the street's address range on the road centerline, offset by a small fixed setback; it has no knowledge of actual parcel geometry. For an irregular-shaped, multi-frontage, deep, or corner lot, the interpolated point can land outside the parcel boundary entirely. Confirmed failure mode: 808 Rhoads Ave, Columbus OH, 2026-07-24 — the geocoded point (39.950329°N) fell *south of the parcel's own bounding-box minimum* (39.950696°N), i.e. off-parcel. Run at that point, the FEMA flood query happened to return the correct answer only because a single Zone X polygon covered the whole area; the Columbus zoning point-query returned an empty result at the same point — silently indistinguishable from "no zoning data" (UNK) rather than "wrong location," and would have been reported as UNVERIFIED had the mismatch not been caught by chance.

Mandatory validation, every parcel (not just "land-heavy" ones — a compact lot on a corner or a deep lot behind a shallow frontage is just as exposed):
1. Pull the parcel polygon from the county GIS. Consult the `county-parcel-screen` skill's `references/county-endpoints.v1.json` registry FIRST (schema and per-county caveats below).
2. Check whether the geocoded point falls inside the parcel polygon's bounding box (cheap: min/max of the ring's x/y vs. the geocoded lon/lat). This is a sufficient sanity check even without true point-in-polygon math.
3. **If the geocode falls OUTSIDE the bbox:** do not use it for Step 2 or Step 6. Recompute a working point from the polygon itself (mean of ring vertices, or a true area centroid) and re-run both queries there. For the FEMA query specifically, prefer querying the full parcel envelope as an `esriGeometryEnvelope` intersects (see Step 2) over any single point — it sidesteps this failure mode entirely and gives the pad/yard split for land-heavy parcels in the same call.
4. **If the geocode falls INSIDE the bbox:** proceed, but still record which point was used (geocode vs. corrected) in the output for audit.
5. For counties where the registry's `arcgis.geometry_type` is `esriGeometryPoint` (MD statewide, except Baltimore Co) or status is `NOT-FOUND`/`VERIFIED-PARTIAL` (Johnson KS, Polk IA, Clay MO, Platte MO, Kent MI), no polygon is available to validate against — say so explicitly in the output ("geocode unvalidated against parcel geometry") rather than silently treating the raw geocode as ground truth.

For the parcel **geometry/CAMA** layer itself: each registry entry gives `arcgis.service_url` + `arcgis.layer_id` + `arcgis.layer_name` + `arcgis.geometry_type` (+ `jurscode` for the three MD counties, which share one statewide service). Most counties return `esriGeometryPolygon` and are directly usable for both this validation step and the pad/yard split; the MD statewide service returns `esriGeometryPoint` (centroid only) for all three MD counties (Anne Arundel, Howard, Baltimore) — Baltimore County is the one exception with a usable polygon: its entry carries a `supplemental_arcgis` block (the county's own GIS, a true polygon layer with owner names) that should be preferred over the statewide point layer there; Anne Arundel and Howard have no such override and must go to Step 3 discovery for a true polygon layer. Two counties (Johnson KS, Polk IA) have `status: "NOT-FOUND"` in the registry — no live public parcel/CAMA endpoint exists; go directly to Step 3 / a manual data request. Three more (Clay MO, Platte MO, Kent MI) are `status: "VERIFIED-PARTIAL"` — usable but treat with extra caution and re-verify before a live run. Fall back to Step 3 discovery for any county absent from the registry entirely.

### Step 2 — FEMA NFHL query (primary)
Base (VERIFIED 2026-06-09, re-verified live 2026-07-19 — service and layer 28 unchanged): `https://hazards.fema.gov/arcgis/rest/services/public/NFHL/MapServer`
- Layer **28 = Flood Hazard Zones**. **Prefer an envelope query over the parcel's full bounding box (from Step 1) whenever a polygon is available** — it's immune to the Step 1 geocode-accuracy failure mode and gives the pad/yard split in the same call:
  `/28/query?geometry={xmin},{ymin},{xmax},{ymax}&geometryType=esriGeometryEnvelope&inSR=4326&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&outFields=FLD_ZONE,ZONE_SUBTY,SFHA_TF,DFIRM_ID&returnGeometry=false&f=json`
  If more than one FLD_ZONE feature intersects, report each and which portion of the parcel it likely covers (pad vs. yard) per Step 1.
- Point query — only when no polygon is available (Step 1's unvalidated-geocode counties) or for a quick single check, and only at a Step-1-validated point:
  `/28/query?geometry={lon},{lat}&geometryType=esriGeometryPoint&inSR=4326&outFields=FLD_ZONE,ZONE_SUBTY,SFHA_TF&returnGeometry=false&f=json`
- `SFHA_TF = "T"` → SFHA. Record FLD_ZONE, ZONE_SUBTY, FIRM panel (layer 3) + effective date.
- Useful layers: 3 FIRM Panels · 16 BFEs · 23 Levees · 27 Flood Hazard Boundaries.
- The service is intermittently unavailable. On timeout/error, retry once, then go to Step 3. Do not loop.

### Step 3 — County/city GIS (flood fallback + zoning primary)
See `references/endpoints.md` for the full directory with VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED status of **flood + zoning** services (the anchors below are the flood/zoning layers, distinct from the parcel/CAMA layers indexed in the `county-parcel-screen` registry referenced in Step 1). Hit the REST root with `?f=json` to enumerate services, find floodplain/zoning layers, then point-query as in Step 2. Verified anchors:
- Cincinnati/Hamilton Co: `https://cagisonline.hamilton-co.org/arcgis/rest/services` (CINC_PLANNING = city zoning)
- Indianapolis/Marion Co: `https://xmaps.indy.gov/arcgis/rest/services` (DMDPortal = zoning)
- Johnson Co KS: `https://maps.jocogov.org/arcgis/rest/services`
- Anne Arundel Co MD: `https://gis.aacounty.org/arcgis/rest/services` (OPZ folders)
- Columbus zoning: `https://maps2.columbus.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Schemas/BuildingZoning/MapServer`

### Step 4 — State floodplain fallbacks
OH: `https://gis.ohiodnr.gov/arcgis/rest/services` (DSW_Services) · IN: INFIP viewer (browser) · WI: DNR Surface Water Data Viewer (browser) · MD: `https://mdfloodmaps.net`.

### Step 5 — Browser-only last resort
FEMA MSC `https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search?AddressQuery={address}` and Municode/AmLegal zoning codes are JS apps — use Claude-in-Chrome tools, not raw fetch. Gahanna's code (codelibrary.amlegal.com) sits behind a bot challenge: browser only. Remember the Gahanna IM overlay: front yard barred from parking/outdoor storage/ground solar.

### Step 6 — Permitted-use check
Run the zoning query at the Step-1-validated point — never an unvalidated geocode. With the zoning designation in hand, list permitted/conditional/prohibited uses relevant to ORA tenancy (warehouse, light mfg, contractor shop, outdoor/IOS storage, fleet parking). Flag: IOS/outdoor storage is the most commonly prohibited use ORA cares about. Cite code section numbers.

### Step 6A — Planned Development (PD/PUD) parcels: the use list is the wrong question (added v1.4)
Fires whenever Step 3/Step 6 returns a **PD / PUD / planned development** designation, and whenever `title-exam-abstraction` routes a PD/PUD condition here. A PD district normally has **no by-right use table** — the code delegates use and site control to the approved PD plan and its agreement, which live in the planning department's file, not in the code. Reporting "PD — no permitted uses listed" or UNVERIFIED because the code lookup came back empty is a false negative.

Three questions replace the permitted-use check. All three go to the planning department, and the answers come back **in writing from a named official**:

1. **What does the approved PD plan show for this parcel?** Request the most recent approved site plan from the department — they hold the file. Do not reconstruct it from the survey or the OM.
2. **Is the current and intended use within the plan?** PD flexibility cuts both ways: an office/warehouse operation can be permitted with no use list at all, while a use ORA routinely underwrites — **outdoor/IOS storage above all** — can sit outside the plan and require the heavy path. This is the same IOS flag as Step 6, but under PD the answer is not in the code.
3. **Which amendment tier does the intended change trigger?** This is the item that carries schedule and cost:
   - **MINOR — administrative.** Approved by staff, by letter; no board hearing. Typically available for changes that do not alter the site's overall character and that *reduce* use or capacity (removing parking is the canonical example). Usually accepts a **hand-marked-up copy of the existing approved site plan** — no new survey, no engineered drawing.
   - **MAJOR — board.** Commission/board approval, public process, real calendar. Triggered by significant site changes and by uses outside the approved plan.

**Underwrite the mechanism, not the reassurance.** "No variance required" and "no special approval needed" are answers to a *use* question and do not mean there is no application to file. Origin, 754 Old State Route 74 (Union Township, Clermont Co OH): the Director of Planning & Zoning confirmed in writing on 7/21/2026 that no special Township approval was needed to remove parking spaces; on the follow-up call the mechanism turned out to be a **minor amendment application** to the PD plan. Nothing was contradicted — the second answer was simply the specific one. Ask "what do we file, and who signs it" every time, before the entitlement path is priced at zero.

**Two PD items that outlive closing:**
- **Change-of-use / re-tenanting trigger.** Where parking or site capacity is reduced under a PD plan, the jurisdiction may require an **updated parking plan filed on each new tenancy** in the affected space (Union Township: its standard change-of-use permit). That is a leasing-cycle obligation, not a closing item — route it to the post-closing operations checklist and price the friction into any re-tenanting assumption that depends on the reconfigured area.
- **Recorded easements are a separate track from zoning.** A municipality confirming that a recorded cross-access or parking instrument is **not** a PD requirement clears the *zoning* question only. The instrument still binds every party and successor; terminating or amending it is a multi-party consent-and-recording exercise run by counsel. Neither clearance substitutes for the other — see `title-exam-abstraction` Step 3D.

Report a PD parcel's ZONING line as:
`PD/PUD — governing instrument: [approved plan + agreement, dated]; intended change: [x]; amendment tier: [MINOR admin / MAJOR board / NONE]; ongoing obligation: [change-of-use filing? y/n]; source: [named official, written, date]`

## Output format (per parcel)
```
FLOOD: [Zone X / SFHA Zone AE ...] — pad: [IN/OUT of SFHA]; excess land: [IN/OUT/N-A]
  Source: [NFHL layer 28 / county layer], panel [#], eff. [date], queried [date]
  Basis impact: [none / land at $0 pending verification / GATE KILL]
ZONING: [designation] ([jurisdiction]) — permitted: [...]; prohibited/conditional: [IOS? ...]
  Source: [GIS service / code section], queried [date]. Zoning letter still required pre-LOI.
VERDICT IMPACT: [e.g., removes T2 cap; score X → Y]
```
Log results to the Notion Deal Sourcing Log `DD-Critical Status` field for the deal, **if a Deal Sourcing Log row exists for it** — not every Pipeline Tracker deal has one (e.g. a broker-submitted deal logged straight to the Pipeline Tracker with no separate sourcing-log entry). When no Sourcing Log row exists, the Pipeline Tracker's own `Next Action` field is the sole and correct record — write the full determination there instead, and don't treat the absence of a Sourcing Log row as a gap to fill.

## Maintenance
Endpoint directory verified 2026-06-09 (see references/endpoints.md for per-URL status). Re-verify UNVERIFIED entries on first use in that market; entry markets (Grand Rapids, Richmond, Des Moines) are unverified wholesale. Suggest a quarterly verification pass alongside ora-replacement-cost-refresh.

## Changelog
- **v1.4 (2026-08-24):** Added **Step 6A — Planned Development (PD/PUD) parcels** and a matching decision rule. Root cause: `title-exam-abstraction` v1.0 routes PD/PUD conditions to this skill, and this skill had no PD doctrine at all — Step 6 assumed a code with a use table behind it, so a PD designation produced either an empty permitted-use result (indistinguishable from UNK) or a use answer to what is really an entitlement-mechanism question. Origin, 754 Old State Route 74 (Union Township, Clermont Co OH): the Township's Director of Planning & Zoning confirmed in writing 7/21/2026 that no special approval was needed to remove parking spaces at the building, and that answer went into the deal-terms register as substantially resolved. The follow-up call (Flaute / E. Goldberg / R. Lauer, notes filed 2026-08-24) established the actual mechanism — a **minor amendment** application to the PD plan, staff-approved by letter, satisfied by a hand-marked-up copy of the existing approved site plan with no new survey — plus the fact that outside storage on the same parcel would be a **major** amendment requiring board approval, and that reduced parking triggers an updated-parking-plan filing on each new tenancy. None of that was wrong in the earlier answer; it simply wasn't the question that had been asked. The step now forces the tier question, the written-from-a-named-official standard, and the separation of recorded-easement clearance from zoning clearance.
- **v1.3 (2026-07-24):** Added mandatory geocode-vs-parcel-geometry validation to Step 1, and made the FEMA envelope-intersect query (Step 2) the preferred form over a single point wherever a parcel polygon is available. Root cause: this skill only required pulling the parcel polygon for "land-heavy" pad/yard splits — nothing required checking a geocoded address point against the parcel before trusting it for the FEMA or zoning query at all. On 808 Rhoads Ave, Columbus OH (2026-07-24 DD pass), the Census geocoder's interpolated address point fell south of the parcel's own bounding-box minimum — outside the parcel. The FEMA query at that point still returned the correct Zone X determination only by coincidence (a single flood polygon covered the whole area); the Columbus zoning point-query at the same bad point returned an empty result, which would have been reported as zoning UNVERIFIED had the mismatch not been caught by manually cross-checking the geocode against the parcel's own bbox after the fact. Also clarified the Output-format Deal Sourcing Log step: not every Pipeline Tracker deal has a Sourcing Log twin (808 Rhoads doesn't — it was logged straight to the Pipeline Tracker), so that step is now explicitly conditional.
- **v1.2 (2026-07-20):** Cross-linked the `county-parcel-screen` skill's `county-endpoints.v1.json` registry (22 counties, live-verified 2026-07-19; committed to the `.claude` repo's `skills/county-parcel-screen/references/` — a separate skill-hosting location from this repo) for the parcel-geometry/CAMA lookup in Step 1 (pad/yard polygon pull), and clarified in Step 3 that this skill's `references/endpoints.md` anchors are the flood/zoning services, distinct from that parcel registry. Step 1 text matches the registry's actual schema (`arcgis.service_url`/`layer_id`/`layer_name`/`geometry_type`, `jurscode` for MD) and flags that all three MD statewide entries are POINT geometry (not sufficient for pad/yard) except Baltimore County, which carries a verified polygon `supplemental_arcgis` entry; Johnson KS and Polk IA have no live registry entry at all (`NOT-FOUND`) and route straight to Step 3; Clay MO, Platte MO, and Kent MI are `VERIFIED-PARTIAL` and need extra caution. FEMA NFHL base (Step 2) re-tested live 2026-07-19 — still up, layer 28 unchanged. Recovers and corrects a cross-link first attempted 2026-07-18/19 (commit `b5ad834`, branch `next5-sourcing-data`) that was abandoned unmerged and initially misjudged as resting on a nonexistent dependency during a 2026-07-20 stale-branch audit — the dependency is real, just lives in a different repo (`.claude`, not `ora-skills`); this version corrects the field-schema and county-status details against the actual committed registry rather than the earlier draft.
- **v1.1 (2026-07-12):** Added the batch-write safety rule (Decision rules section) after a 2026-07-12 Cincinnati auto-DD flood pass wrote determinations directly into the source master workbook in place instead of a new version — caught and hand-remediated same-session, no data lost, but the skill previously gave batch automation no versioning guardrail of its own (unlike its sibling `parcel-data-recovery`, which has carried this as Iron rule 6 since v1.0). Any future batch-scale use of this skill's output against a master workbook must copy-then-write.
- **v1.0:** initial (endpoints verified 2026-06-09).
