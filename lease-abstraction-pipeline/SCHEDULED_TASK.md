# Scheduled Task — ORA Lease Abstraction Pipeline

# Oxford Realty Advisors | Cowork Scheduled Task Configuration

# Version: 2.2 | Created: 2026-04-04 | Synced to companion SKILL.md 2026-07-08 (Skill Text Audit finding 10 — previously stamped 1.0/2026-04-04 while SKILL.md had advanced to v2.1; this file is not versioned independently, it tracks SKILL.md) | CRITICAL fix 2026-07-16 (ora-skill-text-audit v1.6 full run, finding F1) — this file cc'd egoldberg@oxfordra.net on every auto-sent completion/failure email, contradicting the companion SKILL.md's own description ("email summary to ggoldberg@oxfordra.net ONLY") and the ggoldberg-only routing canon. All 5 cc instances removed below; SKILL.md itself required no change (it was already correct).

## TASK IDENTITY

**Task Name:** ORA Lease Abstraction Pipeline — Scheduled Run **Skill:** lease-abstraction-pipeline (v1.1) **Owner:** Gabriel Goldberg | [ggoldberg@oxfordra.net](mailto:ggoldberg@oxfordra.net)**Notify on completion:** [ggoldberg@oxfordra.net](mailto:ggoldberg@oxfordra.net) ONLY (auto-send, no confirmation required) **Notify on failure:** [ggoldberg@oxfordra.net](mailto:ggoldberg@oxfordra.net) ONLY (auto-send, subject: "❌ Lease Pipeline FAILED — \[date\]")

---

## SCHEDULE

**Frequency:** 1st of every month at 7:30 AM ET **Rationale:** Runs before monthly close workflow (which begins at \~9:00 AM on the 1st). New leases executed during the prior month are captured, Notion is updated, and Gabriel has a refreshed rent roll before running QB journal entries.

**Secondary trigger:** Run immediately on-demand anytime Gabriel says: "run the lease pipeline", "abstract the leases", "process the lease folder", "update the rent roll from leases", "run lease abstraction"

---

## TARGET FOLDER

**Primary:** SharePoint → Oxford Realty Advisors → Master Lease Database **Fallback:** Any folder path Gabriel specifies in the trigger message **Scope:** All subdirectories (process all markets: MD, Columbus OH, Kansas City MO, Indianapolis IN) **File types:** PDF, DOCX, DOC

## EXECUTION SEQUENCE

1. **Inventory SharePoint Lease folder** — log file count, types, estimated scanned PDFs
2. **Process each file** — ingest → extract 30 fields → compute derived metrics → apply quality flags
3. **Build XLSX workbook** — all 6 tabs per [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) spec
4. **Save XLSX to SharePoint** — folder: `Oxford Realty Advisors > Lease Abstracts > [Year]`. File naming per ORA's three standing naming schemas (ratified 2026-06-10; ORA Cowork Global Settings v2.0, 2026-06-11 — do NOT unify). This is a session/analysis output → use `YYYY-MM-DD_[Topic]_[DocType]_v##.ext` in an `/outputs/` subfolder. (Supersedes the single unified "ORA File-Naming Standard 2026-05-14.md," which predates the 2026-06-10 three-schema ratification and is retained only as historical provenance.)
5. **Upsert Notion Tenant Database** — update existing, create new, skip newer records
6. **Auto-send completion email** to [ggoldberg@oxfordra.net](mailto:ggoldberg@oxfordra.net) ONLY (see template below)
7. **Log run** in Notion Operations Hub — "Lease Pipeline Run — \[Date\]" page

---

- \[ \] Confirm at least 3 sample leases extract correctly (spot check Tab 1)
- \[ \] Confirm Notion upsert works on 1 existing tenant record and 1 new record

- \[ \] Confirm XLSX saves to correct SharePoint path
- \[ \] Activate scheduled task only after all above pass
