listing_qc.py — Oxford Realty Advisors brokerage listing agreement QC gate.

Scans a broker listing agreement (sale, lease, or sale-and-lease) for the 25
systemic defects catalogued in the C&W form register. Reads DOCX (via
word/document.xml), PDF (via pdftotext, with OCR fallback), or plain text.

Usage:
    python3 listing_qc.py <agreement.docx|pdf|txt> [more ...] [--allow-tokens]
                          [--no-ocr] [--json]

Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = one or more failures, 2 = usage/extraction/
UNREADABLE error.

Severity: BLOCK (do not execute) / HIGH / MED / LOW.

Checks are written to FAIL on the DEFECT. A check that does not fire means the
protective language was found. Every check reports the ORA standing position it
enforces (see references/standing-positions.md).

Extraction, the OCR fallback, the UNREADABLE gate, and the report/CLI harness
now live in ora_doc_qc.py (shared with pma-qc and lease-form-qc). This
retrofit closes a real bug: this file's own former extract() had no OCR
fallback and no "insufficient words" floor, so a scanned counterparty PDF with
no text layer extracted to an empty string, tripped zero of the 25 checks, and
the tool reported the document clean — the worst failure mode a pre-signature
QC gate can have. See ora_doc_qc.py's docstring for the incident that
prompted it.

ora_doc_qc.py itself is NOT vendored inside this skill's scripts/ directory —
it fans out from the repo-root tools/ora_doc_qc.py via package_skills.py's
SHARED_ROOT_DEPS (the same pattern target-markets.json already uses for four
other skills), landing at scripts/ora_doc_qc.py inside the packaged .skill so
this skill installs and runs standalone. In a raw repo/worktree checkout
(where nothing has been packaged yet), the sys.path shim below falls back to
the repo-root tools/ directory so `python listing-agreement-qc/scripts/
listing_qc.py ...` still works for local development.

# Dev-checkout fallback: Python already puts this script's own directory at

# directory as a lower-priority fallback — a packaged .skill ships
# ora_doc_qc.py alongside this script (via SHARED_ROOT_DEPS, see module
# docstring above), so that co-located copy is always tried first,
# structurally, regardless of what does or doesn't exist under an install
# root's own tools/ directory. A raw repo/worktree checkout has no such
# co-located copy, so the appended repo-root tools/ path is what resolves
# ora_doc_qc there. Verified 2026-08-17 against both a raw worktree checkout
# and a real extracted .skill (see task-4-fix-report.md).
