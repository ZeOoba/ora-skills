# Property Management Agreement QC — third-party manager paper (v1.3)

Pre-execution gate for property management agreements where ORA (or an ORA
property entity) is the Owner. Run **before** signature, **before** every annual
auto-renewal, and **before** engaging any third-party leasing broker at a
managed property — the third case is what usually surfaces the agreement's
exclusivity grant for the first time.

For brokerage listing agreements use `listing-agreement-qc`; for ORA's own lease
paper use `lease-form-qc`; for counterparty leases, PSAs, and loan documents use
`legal-intelligence`.

## Why this exists

`listing-agreement-qc` (v1.0, 2026-08-17) gated the *brokerage* engagement.
Nothing gated the *management* engagement — the agreement that, across roughly
27 properties, actually governs who may lease space, who signs the lease, whose
money earns the trust-account interest, and what it costs to leave.

Seed document: the **Kohr Royer Griffith, Inc. Management Agreement** executed
23 December 2020, Owner *Eric Goldberg*, covering five Columbus properties
(2012–2026 Zettler, 2800–2826 Banwick, 384–420 Morrison, 4595–4601 E. 5th Ave,
2000–2008 Zettler). Four pages. It scans **31 of 32**.

Three findings drove the design:

1. **The binding constraint is upstream of price.** The question that produced
   this skill was operational — *can leasing at one building go to another
   party* — and the answer lived in a single adverb in §1 ("appoints the Agent
   **exclusively** to rent, lease, operate and manage"). A fee-focused review
   never reaches it.
2. **A four-page agreement is not a small agreement.** Brevity here is omission:
   no governing law, no venue, no notice address (for an agreement whose only
   exit is a *written notice*), no audit right, no turnover obligation, no
   assignment restriction, no confidentiality covenant. Nine of the 32 checks
   fire on absence, not on language.
3. **Auto-renewal means no one ever re-reads it.** §1 renews annually with no
   notice requirement in either direction. The 2020 form has governed through
   six renewals unexamined; its $2,000 approval threshold and $45/hour rates are
   2020 dollars.

Scanner benchmarks:

| Document | Failures | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| KRG 12.23.2020 (5 properties, executed) | **31 of 32** | v1.0 scan · 5 BLOCK · 15 HIGH · 10 MED · 1 LOW |
| A fully remediated ORA management agreement | **0 of 32** | v1.0 scan · target state · `tests/remediated_fixture.txt` |
| Both, against the v1.2 34-check registry | **not yet re-run** | see Changelog · P32/P33 are new and unscored against KRG |

**v1.2 open item.** P32 and P33 were added without re-running the KRG scan — the
executed agreement was not to hand. Do not quote a 34-check KRG figure until the
scan is re-run against the executed PDF and this table is updated. P32/P33 were
verified against purpose-built defective and remediated fixtures only. (As of
2026-09-21 an OCR text copy of the executed KRG agreement is in the "Property
Management Agreements" claude.ai Project under `claude/text/` — use it to close
this item.)

## The nineteen standing positions — PROPOSED, NOT RATIFIED

`references/standing-positions.md` carries PM-1 … PM-19. **These are drafted
from the KRG review and have not been ratified by Gabriel.** Unlike
`listing-agreement-qc`'s SP-1 … SP-16 (ratified 2026-08-17), they are a proposed
canon: apply them as the review standard, present them as recommendations, and
do not describe any of them as settled ORA policy until ratification is recorded
here and in `event_log.md`.

The five that cost real money, in priority order when a markup must be shortened:

1. **PM-9 — The manager never executes a lease in Owner's name.** The KRG form
   grants authority to "sign, renew and/or cancel leases." This is the direct
   analog of the ratified SP-9 on brokerage paper, where ORA has already won it.
2. **PM-6 — The indemnity does not reach the manager's own negligence.** The KRG
   form has Owner save Agent harmless from *all* damage suits while exculpating
   Agent for everything short of willful misconduct or gross negligence. Owner is
   insuring the manager's ordinary negligence.
3. **PM-1 — Exclusivity is per-property and severable by service line.** Leasing,
   management, and construction supervision are separate grants; a property comes
   off Exhibit A on Owner's notice without terminating the whole agreement.
4. **PM-3 / PM-11 — Every fee base is defined and capped.** "Gross monies
   collected" and "gross lease value" are undefined in the KRG form.
5. **PM-19 — The manager contracts trade work in Owner's name, not its own.**
   The agreement is what authorizes the manager to go buy paving, roofing and
   HVAC work. If it does not require the manager to contract as Owner's
   disclosed agent, the manager signs the trade paper as principal — and the
   warranty, indemnity and payment remedies on a five- or six-figure capital job
   run to a counterparty ORA can terminate on sixty days' notice. Observed live
   in Q3 2026. This is the position that connects `pma-qc` to
   `vendor-management`: PM-19 governs the authority, VC-1 governs the
   instrument that authority produces.

## How to run

### Step 0 — Locate, archive, and provenance-check the document (v1.3)

1. **Find the actual instrument.** A manager's "proposal" usually arrives as an
   email attachment (search Outlook by manager name) and is often also saved
   under OneDrive › `Business/<property>/`. Never evaluate from a filename alone.
2. **Archive it to the "Property Management Agreements" claude.ai Project** as
   extracted text under `claude/proposals/<Manager> -- <Property> (received
   YYYY-MM-DD).txt`, with a header naming the source (email + date, or OneDrive
   path) and the extraction method. A proposal that lives only in Outlook is
   lost to the next review.
3. **P0 — Template-residue check (counterparty forms).** Counterparty templates
   are frequently re-used from another client without scrubbing. Before any
   clause review, confirm every identifying field matches the deal:

   ```bash
   # expected tokens = subject address, owner entity, SF; anything else is residue
   grep -n -i -E "property|commonly known|schedule a|square f|sq ?ft|dated|day of|commencement|expire|owner:|insert|_____" agreement.txt
   ```

   Report as a **BLOCK** labelled `P0 — template residue` if any of these are
   true: the property name/address or Schedule A describes a different asset;
   dates pre-date the request or belong to another engagement; Owner is blank or
   a placeholder ("INSERT ENTITY NAME HERE"); SF in the schedule does not match
   the source of record; number words and numerals disagree ("sixty thirty
   (60)"); fee tiers are internally inconsistent; or clauses from another asset
   class or industry survive (e.g. an Anti-Kickback / 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b
   healthcare clause in an industrial PMA). A residue-bearing document is not
   an offer priced for our asset — flag fee comparisons as provisional until a
   clean property-specific draft is received.
   `scripts/pma_qc.py` does not implement P0 yet; run it manually until the
   scanner is updated (repo work item: add P0 with deal-context arguments
   `--expect-address --expect-sf --expect-owner`).

### Step 1 — Automated scan

```bash
python3 scripts/pma_qc.py <agreement.docx|pdf|txt> [more ...] [--allow-tokens] [--json]
```

Extraction, OCR fallback, and the report/CLI harness live in `ora_doc_qc.py`
(shared with `listing-agreement-qc` and `lease-form-qc`). The module is not
vendored inside this skill's `scripts/` directory — `tools/package_skills.py`'s
`SHARED_ROOT_DEPS` injects a copy from the repo root at packaging time (the
same pattern `target-markets.json` already uses for four other skills),
landing at `scripts/ora_doc_qc.py` inside the packaged `.skill` so pma-qc
installs and runs standalone. In a raw repo/worktree checkout, `pma_qc.py`'s
sys.path fallback resolves the repo-root `tools/` copy instead. Prints one
line per FAIL with severity and the standing position it enforces. Exits
non-zero on any failure or on UNREADABLE.

### Step 2 — Trust the OCR gate; never read a low word count as clean

**This is the trap this scanner exists to close, and the sibling skills had it
too.** The KRG agreement is a scanned image with **no text layer** —
`pdftotext` returns zero bytes. A checker that scans an empty string finds no
defects and reports *clean*. `listing_qc.py` (`listing-agreement-qc`) and
`lease_qc.py` (`lease-form-qc`) carried the same failure mode; both are now
retrofitted onto the same shared `ora_doc_qc.py` UNREADABLE gate described
below (`listing-agreement-qc` v1.1, `lease-form-qc` v2.5.1).

`pma_qc.py` therefore refuses to score a document it could not read:

- Under 150 extracted words → automatic OCR fallback (`pdftoppm -r 300 -png`
  piped to `tesseract`), reported in the header as `EXTRACTION ocr`.
- OCR unavailable, or still under 150 words → **exit 2 with `UNREADABLE`**. It
  does not print a failure count. An unreadable document has no QC result.

OCR text is lossy. When the header reads `EXTRACTION ocr`, treat every *absence*
finding (P16, P19, P24, P27–P30, P33 — checks that fire because language is
missing) as **provisional** and confirm against the page images before
reporting a missing clause to a counterparty. Presence findings are reliable;
absence findings on OCR are not. **Every dollar figure read from OCR must be
confirmed against a crop of the page image before it enters a report or the fee
register** — observed 2026-09-21: tesseract read Peak's "$1250/month" as
"$7250/month" and "$1000" as "$7000".

claude.ai Project uploads of scanned PDFs return empty text to `project_read`.
When that happens, pull the original from OneDrive › `Business/<property>/`
(request folder access on the linked computer, stage, OCR in the cloud
workspace) rather than reporting the agreement as unreviewable, and write the
OCR text back to the Project under `claude/text/` with a source/extraction
header so the next review does not repeat the work.

### Step 3 — Answer the exclusivity question before anything else

Report, in this order, at the top of every review:

1. **Scope of the exclusive grant** — which service lines (lease / manage /
   operate / sell) and which properties.
2. **Severability** — can one property, or one service line, be removed without
   terminating the whole agreement.
3. **Owner carve-outs** — what Owner expressly retained. In the KRG form the
   only one is renewals ("Renewals to be handled by Owner," §2(c)(2)), and that
   single express reservation argues against implying any other.
4. **The exit** — termination mechanics, notice period, notice address, and
   whether any post-termination commission tail exists.
5. **Contracting authority** — what the manager may sign, in whose name, and
   above what dollar figure Owner must approve *and countersign*. State the
   threshold in current dollars and note when it was set: a fixed 2020 figure on
   an auto-renewing agreement has been widening the manager's discretion every
   year since. Then check whether the agreement requires the manager to contract
   as Owner's **disclosed agent** — if not, assume trade paper in the portfolio
   is currently executed in the manager's own name, and pull a recent vendor
   contract to confirm (route it to `vendor-management`).

That block answers the operational question. Everything after it is economics.

### Step 4 — Model the fee stack and benchmark it against the register

```bash
python3 scripts/fee_stack.py --collections 480000 --mgmt-pct 4 --mgmt-floor 850 \
    --lease-value 250000 --lease-pct 6 --capex 120000 --capex-pct 4 \
    --insurance-billings 300000 --insurance-pct 10
```

Prints total annual manager compensation, the effective rate against
collections, and the marginal fee on each event class. The point is the stacking:
the KRG form charges the management percentage on collections, again on capital
projects, and 10% on insurance billings — and because "gross monies collected"
is undefined, insurance proceeds landing in the operating account arguably carry
both. Quantify the overlap before negotiating the headline rate.

**Benchmark source.** Compare against the **ORA Property Management Fee
Register** (`claude/ORA_PM-Fee-Register.md` in the "Property Management
Agreements" Project), not against memory. Express every proposal three ways:
% of gross collections, $/SF/yr, and 10-year cumulative cost including the
escalator (a "greater of CPI or X%" clause is an X% compounding floor — model
it as such). Flat per-SF fees do not fall with vacancy — flag this explicitly
on any lease-up or transition-year asset. The register is a benchmark index,
not a substitute for re-reading the instrument.

### Step 5 — Verify the Owner entity against county owner-of-record

The KRG agreement names **"Eric Goldberg"** individually. If title sits in
property LLCs, the named Owner is not the owner of record. Confirm per property:

```bash
curl -s -G "https://gis.franklincountyohio.gov/hosting/rest/services/ParcelFeatures/Parcel_Features/MapServer/0/query" \
  --data-urlencode "where=SITEADDRESS LIKE '%ZETTLER%'" \
  --data-urlencode "outFields=PARCELID,OWNERNME1,SITEADDRESS,BLDGAREA,CLASSDSCRP" \
  --data-urlencode "returnGeometry=false" --data-urlencode "f=json"
```

Other counties: endpoint registry in `ora-millage-lookup` and
`ora-flood-zoning-dd`. A mismatch is **not** a defense to raise casually — years
of accepted services and paid fees support ratification. Report it as a
conforming amendment to make, not as an escape hatch.

### Step 6 — Rebuild Exhibit A

An address list is not a property schedule. Per PM-17 the exhibit carries, per
property: street address range, **parcel ID(s)**, building SF, the **owning
entity** exactly as the county renders it, and the service lines engaged. Source
SF and entity from the ORA Master Workbook (SharePoint, per the Notion pointer
page), never from the agreement's own recitals.

### Step 7 — Agreement-folder close-out

Run `references/agreement-folder-checklist.md` — eleven artifacts, of which the
certificate of fidelity bond, the manager's E&O certificate, and the
countersigned copy are the ones routinely absent.

### Step 8 — Report

Order findings P0 (template residue, if any) → BLOCK → HIGH → MED → LOW, after
the Step 3 exclusivity block. For each: the defect, the failure scenario in
dollars where quantifiable, and the exact replacement language from
`references/standing-positions.md`. Close with an explicit **execute / do not
execute** (new agreement) or **renew / renegotiate / terminate** (existing
agreement) recommendation. Deliver as DOCX per the ORA Style Guide with the
16-point QC Gate applied.

### Step 9 — Update the fee register (v1.3)

Every review ends by updating `claude/ORA_PM-Fee-Register.md` in the Project:
add or amend the property's row (proposals go in a PROPOSED row until
executed), refresh "Portfolio norms" if the benchmark moved, and add any new
data-quality item (wrong owner entity, blank fee amount, missing pages). Read
the register first and write the full file back (no in-place patch).

## Renewal-cycle use

For an agreement already in force, the deliverable is a decision, not a markup.
Compute and state:

- **Days to the next auto-renewal**, and the last date a termination notice can
  be delivered to take effect before it.
- **Trailing 12-month fees actually paid**, from QuickBooks, against the fee
  stack model.
- **What termination costs**: any tail, any assumed vendor contracts (KRG §3(c)
  makes Owner assume every contract the Agent signed, with no schedule of what
  those are — demand the schedule before terminating, not after), and the
  transition burden the agreement fails to place on the manager.

## Scope boundaries

| Situation | Skill |
|---|---|
| Third-party property management agreement, ORA as Owner | **this skill** |
| Broker listing agreement (sale or lease), ORA as Owner | `listing-agreement-qc` |
| ORA's own lease form going to a tenant | `lease-form-qc` |
| Counterparty lease, PSA, loan doc | `legal-intelligence` |
| A trade contract the manager procured (paving, roofing, snow, HVAC) | `vendor-management` |
| Amending a lease already in effect | `lease-addendum` |
| Whether to self-manage vs. third-party manage | `re-operations` / `portfolio-growth` |
| Drafting the manager engagement or termination email | `communication-intelligence` |

## Hard rules

- This skill **reviews**. It never sends. A markup or a termination notice going
  to a manager is an outbound communication to an external counterparty and
  requires Gabriel's explicit in-turn confirmation (standing invariant 1).
- **A termination notice is irreversible in practice.** Even where the agreement
  permits at-will termination, delivering notice ends a relationship that
  currently holds the tenant files, the deposits, and the vendor contracts. Model
  the transition before recommending it.
- Never state a governing fee, threshold, or termination date from memory or from
  a prior review. Re-read the executed agreement each time.
- PM-1 … PM-19 are **proposed**, not ratified. Say so in every report that cites
  them.

## Changelog

- **v1.3 (2026-09-21)** — Adds **Step 0** (locate the instrument, archive the
  proposal text to the Project, and the **P0 template-residue check**, reported
  as a BLOCK), **Step 9** (update the ORA PM Fee Register), register-based
  benchmarking in Step 4 (% / $/SF / 10-yr cost; CPI-or-X% escalators modeled
  as an X% floor; vacancy insensitivity of flat per-SF fees), and a mandatory
  page-image check for OCR dollar figures plus the OneDrive-OCR fallback for
  empty Project scans in Step 2. Prompted by the Neyer Management 2026 PMA
  template for 754 Old SR 74, which arrived carrying another client's property
  (Fairfield Professional Park, Mack Rd), dates, SF, a garbled construction-fee
  tier and a healthcare Anti-Kickback clause; and by a tesseract misread of
  Peak's $1,250 fee as $7,250. P0 is procedural only — `pma_qc.py` does not
  implement it yet.

- **v1.2 (2026-09-09)** — Adds **PM-19** (manager contracting authority) and the
  two checks that enforce it: **P32** (BLOCK — manager may contract capital or
  vendor work in its own name, with no disclosed-agency requirement) and **P33**
  (HIGH — approval threshold present but no Owner countersignature, unindexed, or
  with an unbounded emergency exception). Registry 32 -> 34 checks; positions 18
  -> 19. Step 3 gains a fifth reporting item, contracting authority. Routing row
  added for `vendor-management`, the companion skill that QCs the trade paper
  this authority produces. Prompted by a Q3 2026 paving proposal on an ORA-owned
  asset that named the property manager as Purchaser under a form barring any
  non-party from claiming a remedy — the warranty ran to the manager, not to the
  owning entity. Description trimmed to headroom 63 to absorb the new trigger
  vocabulary. **KRG benchmark not re-run — see the open item above.**

- **v1.1 (2026-08-24)** — Description trimmed to restore headroom (was
  1002/1024, headroom 22 -- close-out work-order item 4). Dropped the named
  third-party manager-firm examples parenthetical; no trigger vocabulary or
  named-defect clause removed. `description_budget.py` now reports headroom 79.

- **v1.0 (2026-08-17)** — Initial. 32 checks, 18 proposed standing positions,
  fee-stack model, agreement-folder checklist, KRG form defect register.
  Benchmarked at 31/32 (KRG 12.23.2020) and 0/32 (remediated fixture). Adds the OCR/unreadable gate that
  `listing_qc.py` lacks — a scanned PDF with no text layer must never score as
  clean.
