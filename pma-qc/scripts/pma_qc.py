pma_qc.py — Oxford Realty Advisors property management agreement QC gate.

Scans a third-party property management agreement (ORA or an ORA entity as
Owner) for the 32 systemic defects catalogued in the KRG form register.

Usage:
    python3 pma_qc.py <agreement.docx|pdf|txt> [more ...] [--allow-tokens]
                      [--no-ocr] [--json]

Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = one or more failures, 2 = usage/extraction/
UNREADABLE error.

Severity: BLOCK (do not execute) / HIGH / MED / LOW.

Checks FAIL on the DEFECT. A check that does not fire means the protective
language was found. Every check reports the ORA standing position it enforces
(see references/standing-positions.md — PM-1 .. PM-18, PROPOSED not ratified).

Extraction, the OCR fallback, the UNREADABLE gate, and the report/CLI harness
now live in ora_doc_qc.py (shared with listing-agreement-qc and lease-form-qc
once their own retrofits land — see that module's migration notes). This file
is the reference port: everything below the imports is pma-qc's own 32 checks.

ora_doc_qc.py itself is NOT vendored inside this skill's scripts/ directory —
it fans out from the repo-root tools/ora_doc_qc.py via package_skills.py's
SHARED_ROOT_DEPS (the same pattern target-markets.json already uses for four
other skills), landing at scripts/ora_doc_qc.py inside the packaged .skill so
this skill installs and runs standalone. In a raw repo/worktree checkout
(where nothing has been packaged yet), the sys.path shim below falls back to
the repo-root tools/ directory so `python pma-qc/scripts/pma_qc.py ...` still
works for local development.

from pathlib import Path

# Dev-checkout fallback: a packaged .skill ships ora_doc_qc.py alongside this
# script (via SHARED_ROOT_DEPS, see module docstring above) — Python already
# puts this script's own directory at sys.path[0] on startup, so the packaged
# copy resolves there before this insert is ever consulted. A raw repo/worktree
# checkout has no such copy, so this fallback resolves the repo-root tools/
# directory instead — the only place the path below ever actually exists is a
# dev checkout (`.../ora-skills/pma-qc/scripts/` -> parent.parent.parent ->
# `.../ora-skills/tools/`); in every packaged/extracted-.skill location the
# equivalent path doesn't exist on disk and Python silently skips it, so this
# never shadows the packaged copy. Verified 2026-08-17 against a real
# extracted .skill (see task-4-report.md).
