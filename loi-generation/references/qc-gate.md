# 23-Point QC Gate — LOI Pre-Transmission Checklist

This gate runs after document assembly and before the file is presented or shipped. Every item must pass; if any fails, fix and re-run. Do not present a failing file.

| # | Check | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | All `{{TOKENS}}` resolved; no gold sans-serif placeholders remain in body | Grep PDF text for `\{\{[A-Z_]+\}\}` — must return zero |
| 2 | All `▶ CONDITIONAL ◀` blocks evaluated; markers removed | Grep PDF text for `CONDITIONAL` — must return zero |
| 3 | §6 language matches property state | Confirm state-specific transfer-tax / proration language present |
| 4 | Section numbering sequential; non-binding paragraph cross-references match retained sections | Read non-binding paragraph; verify each `§N` cited exists |
| 5 | Template Metadata page deleted; State Overlay Appendix deleted | Confirm document starts with letterhead + date and ends with proof-of-funds page |
| 6 | Tenancy disclosure in opening paragraph matches `{{PROPERTY_TENANCY_PHRASE}}` | Read intro; verify "vacant" / "single-tenant" / "multi-tenant" matches the deal |
| 7 | Economic terms within ORA acceptable ranges | EMD, Study Period, Closing, Exclusivity all within ranges in `ora-standards.md` |
| 8 | Buyer signatory matches user instruction | Execution page reads "Gabriel Goldberg / Authorized Representative" (or override) |
| 9 | Letterhead phone reads **301.512.6125** in both top and bottom letterhead tables | Grep PDF for `301.983.8000` — must return zero; grep for `301.512.6125` — must return ≥2 |
| 10 | Footer reads `[PROPERTY_STREET_ADDRESS] LOI · Page X of Y` with PAGE/NUMPAGES fields | Visual inspection of any page footer |
| 11 | "Proof of funds available upon request." appears centered, italic, grey on the very last page, lower third | Visual inspection of last page; grep for "Proof of funds available upon request" — must return exactly 1 |
| 12 | Tenant count in BUYER INFORMATION trailer reads "approximately 140 tenants" | Grep PDF for "170 tenants" — must return zero; grep for "140 tenants" — must return 1 |
| 13 | Offer expiration date is a business day at least 5 business days from LOI date | Calendar arithmetic |
| 14 | EXECUTION PAGE present with Buyer block populated, Seller entity name filled | Visual inspection |
| 15 | Strike list clean | Grep for `\bshall\b` (excluding "shallow") — must return zero. Grep for each banned phrase — must return zero |
| 16 | PDF generated via `soffice` (not Microsoft Print to PDF); extractable text confirmed | `pdftotext` round-trip yields readable text |
| 17 | Pagination: Buyer Information page starts its own page (page_break_before on its heading, never stacked empty paragraphs); proof-of-funds line sits on the final page lower third; page count = 5 (CONDENSED) or 6–8 (STANDARD) | Visual inspection; strip empty/page-break-before paragraph runs during assembly — known template defect otherwise renders 7–8 pages |
| 18 | Entity-interest language matches seller suffix (Rule 0) | "membership interests" must never ship against an Inc/Corp seller |
| 19 | Zoning phrase matches the OM verbatim | Compare `{{PROPERTY_ZONING_PHRASE}}` against source OM/listing text |
| 20 | If concealment overlay active (Rule 0c): leak-check confirms zero occurrences of "1031" / "exchange" / "drop-and-swap" | Grep final document text for each term — must return zero |
| 21 | Deposit-timing consistency: all Deposit due-window mentions resolve from `{{EMD_DUE_DAYS_WORDS}}` and are identical in the final text | Grep for every deposit-due mention; confirm same value throughout |
| 22 | Vacant deals: preservation covenant present; casualty threshold "five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price" survived CONDENSED compression | Visual inspection of Continued Operations / Casualty sections |
| 23 | **Offer ≤ Walk Price (hard fail).** `ORA Offer Price` does not exceed the `Walk Price` from `acquisition-underwriting`; an overage passes only against a ratified Exception Register entry | Compare the two figures before saving. On FAIL, refuse to save and report the offer, the walk price, and the $ and % gap. The PDF helper below cannot check this (the walk price is not in the document), so verify it by hand every run |
