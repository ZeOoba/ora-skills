# Property Tax Appeal Decision Engine (v1.4)

Systematic tax assessment analysis and appeal recommendation for Oxford Realty Advisors.

---

## 1. ASSESSMENT DATA COLLECTION

When a tax assessment is provided (uploaded bill, manual input, or Notion lookup):

### Required Inputs
| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Property address | User or Notion Property Financials |
| Current assessed value | Tax bill or county assessor website |
| Prior year assessed value | Tax bill or county assessor website |
| Tax rate / millage | Tax bill or county lookup |
| Annual tax amount | Tax bill (calculated: assessed value × millage) |
| Assessment date | Tax bill |
| Appeal deadline | Jurisdiction-specific (see Section 5) |
| Current in-place NOI | Notion Property Financials or user input |
| Property SF | Notion Tenant Database or user input |
| Year built | Notion or county assessor |

### Auto-Calculate
- YoY assessment change: `(Current - Prior) / Prior × 100`
- Effective tax rate: `Annual Tax / Market Value estimate`
- Tax per SF: `Annual Tax / Property SF`
- Tax as % of NOI: `Annual Tax / NOI × 100`

---

## 2. THREE-APPROACH VALUATION

### A. Income Approach (Primary for Oxford properties)
```
Income Approach Value = Stabilized NOI / Market Cap Rate
```

**NOI Determination:**
- Use trailing 12-month NOI from Property Financials (preferred)
- Or construct from: Gross Potential Rent - Vacancy Allowance (5-10%) - Operating Expenses
- Exclude capital expenditures, debt service, depreciation
- Include management fee (even if self-managed, impute 3-5% for valuation)

**Cap Rate Selection:**
- Use the acquisition-underwriting skill's COMP GRID DISCIPLINE section (`rent-comp` retired 2026-08-05; comp-grid mechanics absorbed into acquisition-underwriting v4.11, 2026-08-12 — market-monitor's Sourcing Discipline section covers vendor-report credibility only, not comp-grid method) to pull recent sale comps and extract cap rates
- Or search: "[city] [property type] cap rate [year]"
- Apply appropriate cap rate for property class and condition
- Use cap rate RANGE to establish value range (not single point)

**Output:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stabilized NOI | $X |
| Market Cap Rate (low) | X.X% |
| Market Cap Rate (mid) | X.X% |
| Market Cap Rate (high) | X.X% |
| Income Value (low) | $X |
| Income Value (mid) | $X |
| Income Value (high) | $X |

### B. Comparable Sales Approach
- Use the acquisition-underwriting skill's COMP GRID DISCIPLINE section (`rent-comp` retired 2026-08-05; absorbed into acquisition-underwriting v4.11, 2026-08-12) to pull 3-6 recent comparable sales
- Calculate median and mean price/SF from comps
- Apply to subject property: `Comparable Value = Median Price/SF × Subject SF`
- Adjust for: age, condition, location, occupancy, lease quality

### C. Cost Approach (Supporting)
```
Cost Approach Value = Land Value + (Replacement Cost - Depreciation)
```
- **Land value:** County assessor land-only value OR comparable land sales
- **Replacement cost:** `maintenance-analytics` retired 2026-08-05, no successor named — search construction costs directly
- **Depreciation:** `Age / Useful Life × Replacement Cost` (straight-line, 40-year life for industrial), **clamped to a maximum of 90% of Replacement Cost** (a 10% residual floor — conventional appraisal practice; a fully depreciated shell still has salvage/land-assemblage value). Never let Age/Useful Life exceed 1.0 before applying it — ORA's Class B/C buy-box sits at or below the ramp's 1995 vintage endpoint (see acquisition-underwriting/SKILL.md Stage 1), so buildings past the 40-year life are the norm, not the exception, and an unclamped ratio drives Depreciation above 100% of Replacement Cost, making the improvement contribution — and potentially the whole Cost Approach Value — negative. If the subject had a material renovation, use the effective vintage from acquisition-underwriting/SKILL.md's renovation effective-vintage rule (Stage 1) instead of the actual year built, so a renovated older building isn't over-depreciated.

## 3. APPEAL DECISION MATRIX

Score the appeal opportunity on a 12-point scale:

| Criterion | Points | Condition |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Income approach gap | +3 | Assessed value > income approach (mid) by >15% |
| Sales comp gap | +3 | Assessed value > comparable sales value by >15% |
| YoY spike | +2 | Assessment increased >10% YoY without physical improvement |
| Dollar savings | +2 | Potential annual tax savings > $5,000 |
| Timeline | +1 | Appeal deadline is >30 days away |
| Jurisdiction track record | +1 | Jurisdiction has historically favorable appeal outcomes |

### Decision Thresholds
| Score | Recommendation | Action |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| **8-12** | **STRONG APPEAL — Proceed** | Generate full appeal package |
| **5-7** | **MODERATE — Analyze Further** | Refine valuation, consider attorney cost vs. savings |
| **0-4** | **WEAK — Likely Not Worth It** | Document analysis, revisit next reassessment cycle |

### ROI Calculation
```
Estimated Annual Savings = (Current Tax) - (Proposed Value × Millage)
Appeal Cost = Attorney fees ($2,000-5,000 typical) + filing fees + appraisal ($1,500-3,000 if needed)
Payback Period = Appeal Cost / Annual Savings
3-Year ROI = (Annual Savings × 3 - Appeal Cost) / Appeal Cost × 100
```

Flag if payback period > 2 years (marginal return).

## 4. APPEAL PACKAGE GENERATION

If proceeding with appeal (score ≥5):

### Document Assembly
Use the docx skill to produce an appeal letter including:

1. **Cover letter** on ORA letterhead addressed to the appropriate review board
2. **Property description** with photos, SF, year built, condition notes
3. **Income approach analysis** with NOI documentation and cap rate support
4. **Comparable sales** with adjustment grid
5. **Proposed value** with supporting rationale
6. **Exhibits:**
   - A: Rent roll (redacted tenant names if confidential)
   - B: Operating expense summary
   - C: Sale comparable data sheets
   - D: Market report excerpts supporting cap rate
   - E: Photos of deferred maintenance or functional obsolescence (if applicable)

File naming: per ORA's three standing naming schemas (ratified 2026-06-10; ORA Cowork Global Operating Prompt v3.0, 2026-07-16 — do NOT unify; supersedes the archived v2.0/2026-06-11 doc of the same ratified rule). This appeal package is a session/analysis output → use `YYYY-MM-DD_[Topic]_[DocType]_v##.ext` in an `/outputs/` subfolder. (Supersedes the single unified "ORA File-Naming Standard 2026-05-14.md," which predates the 2026-06-10 three-schema ratification and is retained only as historical provenance.)

### Attorney Referral
Reference the Gibbs Firm (Oxford's property tax counsel) for jurisdictions requiring legal representation. Include:
- Jurisdiction
- Property parcel number
- Current assessed value
- Proposed value
- Supporting documentation package
- Appeal deadline

## 5. JURISDICTION-SPECIFIC PROCEDURES

> **Confirm the MECHANISM with the board, not just the answer (added v1.3, 2026-08-24).** The deadlines and
> processes below are a starting point that goes stale; the per-jurisdiction notes already say to verify them.
> Verifying means more than re-confirming a date. When a board clerk, assessor or county office tells you
> something favorable — "you can still file for that year," "no formal hearing is needed," "we can adjust it
> administratively," "just send it in" — that answers the question you asked and stops there. Before it is
> recorded as resolved, get, in writing where possible, from a **named** person: **which form or complaint
> instrument gets filed · who must sign it (owner, officer, attorney — several states restrict who may file
> on an entity's behalf) · where it is filed and by what date · whether it is decided administratively or at
> a hearing · and what the decision instrument is** (a letter, a board order, a stipulation). An
> administrative adjustment and a BOR complaint carry entirely different calendars, evidence burdens, and
> appeal rights, and "we can just fix that" is said about both. A filing path that has not been named is not
> a filing path, and an appeal whose mechanism is unconfirmed should not be carried in the ROI calc as though
> only the deadline stood between ORA and the reduction. Same discipline as `ora-flood-zoning-dd` Step 6A
> (entitlements) and `ora-millage-lookup` (rate pulls).

### Ohio — Franklin County (Columbus properties)
- **Board:** Franklin County Board of Revision
- **Cycle:** Annual assessment, triennial reappraisal
- **Deadline:** March 31 of the tax year (file complaint with BOR)
- **Process:** Informal hearing → Board of Revision → Board of Tax Appeals → Court
- **Notes:** Ohio allows complaints for ANY year in the triennial cycle. Over-assessments can be challenged using income approach. Use web_search to verify current deadlines.

### Maryland (DC Metro / Baltimore properties)
- **Board:** Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT)
- **Cycle:** Triennial reassessment (phased in over 3 years)
- **Deadline:** Within 45 days of assessment notice
- **Process:** Written appeal to SDAT → Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board → Maryland Tax Court
- **Notes:** Phase-in means you appeal the final value, not the phased value. Check which triennial group each property falls in.

### Indiana (Indianapolis properties)
- **Board:** County Assessor → Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA)
- **Cycle:** Annual trending, full reassessment every 5 years (was 4)
- **Deadline:** June 15 (or 45 days after notice, whichever is later)
- **Process:** Informal with assessor → PTABOA → Indiana Board of Tax Review → Tax Court
- **Notes:** Indiana uses a cost approach as the starting point but accepts income approach for commercial.

### Missouri — Jackson County (Kansas City properties)
- **Board:** Jackson County Board of Equalization
- **Cycle:** Biennial reassessment (odd years for commercial)
- **Deadline:** Typically July 1 of reassessment year
- **Process:** Informal with assessor → Board of Equalization → State Tax Commission → Circuit Court
- **Notes:** Jackson County has been controversial for assessment practices. Always verify current procedures via web_search.

**IMPORTANT:** Always use web_search to verify current appeal deadlines before advising. Deadlines change and missing them is fatal to the appeal.

## 6. PORTFOLIO-WIDE TAX ANALYSIS

When requested, run the assessment analysis across the entire portfolio:

1. Pull all property assessments (from Notion Property Financials or user upload)
2. Run the 3-approach valuation for each property
3. Score each property using the appeal decision matrix
4. Rank by potential annual tax savings (descending)
5. Produce a priority list: which properties to appeal first
6. Calculate total portfolio tax savings opportunity

Output as XLSX per ORA's three standing naming schemas (ratified 2026-06-10; ORA Cowork Global Operating Prompt v3.0, 2026-07-16 — do NOT unify; supersedes the archived v2.0/2026-06-11 doc of the same ratified rule). This portfolio tax-savings workbook is a session/analysis output → use `YYYY-MM-DD_[Topic]_[DocType]_v##.ext` in an `/outputs/` subfolder. (Supersedes the single unified "ORA File-Naming Standard 2026-05-14.md," which predates the 2026-06-10 three-schema ratification and is retained only as historical provenance.)

## Changelog

- v1.4 (2026-11-05): §7 deadline tracking repointed from `ora-pm-ledger`, which is currently not running (disabled since the 2026-09-22 fleet pause, which the stalled 2026-09-28 resume did not undo; Gabriel deferred its status 2026-10-30), to `outlook-calendar-sync`, which puts dated deadlines and hearings on Gabriel's Outlook calendar. No scoring, threshold, or valuation math changed. Review corrections applied the same day: the pause date was corrected, and filing deadlines now also get a reminder-task proposal and a `monthly-close` checklist line. No scored or governor constant changed.
- v1.3 (2026-08-24): Added the **confirm-the-mechanism** rule at the head of §5. The jurisdiction table already told the reader to re-verify deadlines; it said nothing about the far more common failure, which is taking a favorable answer from a board clerk or assessor as a resolved filing path. "You can still file for that year," "no hearing needed," and "we can adjust that administratively" each answer the question asked and stop there — and an administrative adjustment and a formal BOR complaint carry different calendars, evidence burdens and appeal rights. The rule now requires the instrument, the permitted signatory (several states restrict who may file for an entity), the venue and date, whether it is decided administratively or at a hearing, and what the decision instrument is; an appeal whose mechanism is unconfirmed must not be carried in the §3 ROI calc as if only the deadline stood in the way. Sibling rules landed the same day in `ora-flood-zoning-dd` Step 6A (entitlements, the origin case at 754 Old State Route 74) and `ora-millage-lookup` (rate pulls). No scoring, threshold, or valuation math changed.
- v1.2 (2026-08-15): HIGH fix (Skill Text Audit findings F1/coverage-gap-3). §2.A/§2.B comp-grid pointers repointed from market-monitor (which never had comp-grid mechanics — its "absorbed" claim didn't survive inspection) to acquisition-underwriting's COMP GRID DISCIPLINE section, absorbed there 2026-08-12 per Gabriel's scoped-restore ruling; §7 cross-skill integration line repointed to match. File-naming citations in §4/§6 updated from the archived "ORA Cowork Global Settings v2.0" (2026-06-11) to the current "ORA Cowork Global Operating Prompt v3.0" (2026-07-16) — the underlying three-schema rule is unchanged, only the version/document-name citation. No scoring, threshold, or valuation math changed.
- v1.1 (2026-07-08): HIGH fix (beyond formal Skill Text Audit scope, same doctrine class as finding 5) — both file-naming citations (Appeal package, §4; Portfolio-wide XLSX, §6) repointed from the superseded single "ORA File-Naming Standard 2026-05-14.md" to the ratified three-schema doctrine (ORA Cowork Global Settings v2.0, 2026-06-10/11).

## 7. CROSS-SKILL INTEGRATION

- **acquisition-underwriting:** Pull sale comps for comparable sales approach and cap rate data for income approach via its COMP GRID DISCIPLINE section (`rent-comp` retired 2026-08-05, absorbed into acquisition-underwriting v4.11, 2026-08-12)
- **acquisition-underwriting:** Tax analysis is a standard component of deal underwriting — feed assessed value and tax rate into pro forma
- **(no successor):** `maintenance-analytics` retired 2026-08-05 with no successor named — deferred-maintenance depreciation arguments in the cost approach need a manual source until one exists
- **outlook-calendar-sync:** Put each confirmed appeal deadline and hearing date on Gabriel's Outlook calendar; that skill sets no reminder. For each statutory filing deadline, also propose a one-time reminder task through `register-scheduled-task`, the pattern `ora-jackson-boe-prep-reminder` and `ora-wicomico-reassessment-reminder` already use, and list upcoming deadlines in the `monthly-close` checklist. `ora-pm-ledger`, the daily ops ledger this line used to name for deadline tracking, is currently not running (disabled since the 2026-09-22 fleet pause, which the stalled 2026-09-28 resume did not undo; Gabriel deferred its status 2026-10-30), so do not rely on it. (`re-operations` retired 2026-08-05, redundant with named ops siblings.)
- **document-assembly:** Generate appeal letters using the ORA letterhead template
