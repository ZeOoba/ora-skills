# DEAL FOLDER INTAKE — ORA acquisition package archiving

Turns a pile of uploaded deal documents into a permanent, verifiable deal folder: **structure → hash-verify → manifest → mirror → memory pointer → register reconciliation.** Session upload folders are ephemeral; anything not archived is lost when the session ends.

## SCOPE

**This skill files. It does not analyze.**

| Request | Route |
|---|---|
| "store / archive / save this package" | **This skill** |
| "underwrite / screen / evaluate this" | `acquisition-underwriting` |
| "is this worth pursuing" (one target) | `verified-deal-recon` |
| "abstract these leases" | `lease-abstraction-pipeline` |
| "reconcile the PSA" | `psa-reconciliation` |

If the user wants both filing and analysis, **file first** (the source files are perishable), then hand off. Never let an underwrite request end without the package archived.

**Hard Invariant 3 check before anything else:** if the deal is on the active confidential roster, it is archived normally but never named on an external surface — no artifact publish, no external send. If confidential-deal state is unavailable on the current surface, verify before naming the deal outside ORA systems; if unverifiable, ask.

---

## STAGE 1 — INVENTORY AND IDENTIFY

1. List every uploaded file with size and modified date. Do not skip files you cannot parse — a proprietary binary still gets archived.
2. Establish the deal identity from the package: full street address(es), city, county, state, ZIP. The county matters — it drives the tax-record bucket.
3. **Check for an existing folder for this deal before creating anything.** Search the outputs folder and the mirror target for the address, an abbreviation, and the property name. If one exists, add to it and version the manifest (`_v02`); never create a second folder for the same asset.
4. Derive the folder name: `Property_Name_City_ST` in underscores, e.g. `Old_Alexandria_Ferry_Clinton_MD`, `3700_REDACTED-158_Madison_WI`. Stable for the life of the deal — closed and passed deals keep the name they were filed under.

---

## STAGE 2 — STRUCTURE

```
<Property_Name_City_ST>/
├── YYYY-MM-DD_<Property>_SourceManifest_v01.md
├── 00_Dossier/            canonical narrative, if one exists
├── 01_Broker_Package/     OM, flyer, rent roll, Argus/broker exports
├── 02_Leases_Executed/    signed leases, amendments, guaranties, estoppels
├── 03_Tax_Records/        assessment notices, tax bills, appeal filings
├── 04_Site_and_Market/    site plan, survey, title, environmental, CoStar
├── 05_ORA_Underwrite/     ORA model, IC memo, LOI, deal-terms register
└── archive/               superseded versions — never delete
```

Create every bucket even when empty; a missing bucket reads as "not received" and an empty one reads as "nothing yet." Add buckets only when a package genuinely needs one (`06_Debt/` for a loan assumption, `07_Closing/` post-PSA).

**Naming — do not unify the schemas (CLAUDE.md doctrine):**

- **Counterparty-supplied files keep their original filenames verbatim**, typos included (`Costar Reporrt ...pdf` stays misspelled). Renaming breaks every citation in the dossier, IC memo and model, and destroys the provenance link to what the broker actually sent. This overrides the deal-file naming schema, which governs documents ORA *authors*.
- **ORA-authored models** keep `ORA_[DocType]_[Property]_v[X.Y].xlsx`.
- **Session work-product** (manifest, dossier) uses `YYYY-MM-DD_[Topic]_[DocType]_v##.ext`.
- **Never delete. Move to `/archive/`.**

---

## STAGE 3 — COPY AND VERIFY (non-negotiable)

Copy, then prove the copy. An unverified archive is not an archive.

1. SHA-256 every source file and every archived file.
2. Compare **hash sets and file counts** in both directions. Report `HASH MATCH` only when both agree.
3. Any mismatch or count gap stops the run and is reported — never papered over.

**Windows MAX_PATH trap — this will bite.** Cowork session paths run ~215 characters before the deal folder even starts, so `Copy-Item` fails with `DirectoryNotFoundException` on files that plainly exist. Symptoms: the copy dies on one deep file while shallower ones succeed.

- Use `robocopy <src> <dst> /E /COPY:DAT /R:1 /W:1 /NFL /NDL /NP` — long-path safe. Exit codes **0–7 are success** (1 = files copied); only ≥8 is failure.
- `Get-ChildItem "\\?\<path>"` silently returns **zero items** in Windows PowerShell 5.1 — it does not error, it just yields nothing, which makes a broken verification look like an empty folder. Never verify the long side that way. Hash the long path from the POSIX shell (where the session folder is mounted at a short path) and the short side in PowerShell, then compare.
- Build any multi-step PowerShell as a `.ps1` file and run it with `-File`. Inline `-Command` mangles `$_` and nested quotes.

---

## STAGE 4 — MANIFEST

One markdown file at the folder root. This is what a future session reads first.

Required sections:

1. **Header** — address, county, date, deal status in one line (verdict, ask, walk price if underwritten; `NOT YET UNDERWRITTEN` if not), and the underwrite of record.
2. **Folder structure** — the tree, so nobody guesses.
3. **File register** — a row per file: filename, bucket, *what it is and why it matters*, read/not-read status, bytes, SHA-256 prefix. "What it is" earns its place: `RET Bill_7458.pdf — PG County Tax Inquiry, acct 0959445, FY27 — the load-bearing verification` tells a future session where the deal turns. Flag any file whose content contradicts the rent roll or the OM.
4. **Sources cited but NOT held as files** — broker e-mails, GIS pulls, assessor sites, market reports, anything consulted live. This section is the one people skip and the one that costs a re-underwrite. Name each source specifically enough to re-pull.
5. **Open items** — every unresolved DD-Critical, data conflict, and unverified assertion, numbered. Include the re-engage trigger.
6. **Verification line** — "All N archived copies verified byte-identical to the files as received (SHA-256, DD Mon YYYY)."

---

## STAGE 5 — MIRROR

The Cowork outputs folder persists on the user's machine but is not the firm's document store.

- **Mirror target:** `C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive - Oxford Capital Partners\Claude_Workspace\01_Workspace\Deals\<Property_Name_City_ST>`. `Claude_Workspace` is free working surface under Hard Invariant 5 — no permission needed.
- **Re-verify hashes at the destination.** A mirror is not done until it is proven.
- **Non-Claude Oxford OneDrive business folders** (`Investment Candidates -- 2026`, property folders, accounting) are **read-only without explicit permission**. If the deal's natural home is one of those, mirror to `Claude_Workspace` and *ask* before writing to the business folder. Do not assume the ask.
- Note in the manifest where the mirror lives and when it was last verified.

---

## STAGE 6 — MEMORY POINTER

The folder is worthless if the next session cannot find it.

- **Update the existing deal memory** if one exists — do not create a second. Add a "Where everything lives" paragraph: folder path, bucket-by-bucket contents, verification date, and the sources *not* held.
- If no deal memory exists, write one (`type: project`) carrying the verdict or `NOT YET UNDERWRITTEN`, the economics that decide it, and the archive pointer. Link related memories with `[[slug]]`.
- Add or update the one-line `MEMORY.md` index entry.
- Convert relative dates to absolute.

---

## STAGE 6B — PROPERTY REGISTER RECONCILIATION (v1.1)

Runs when the package contains a settlement statement, deed, ALTA/HUD statement, PSA or closing statement for a CLOSED ORA property. Skip for unclosed or passed deals. Added after the retro-underwrite found blank purchase prices and conflicting dates in the Notion Property Register that the original settlement statements would have resolved.

1. Fetch the deal's row in the Notion Property Register (query by address; the row URL goes in the manifest).
2. Compare four fields against the closing documents: **Purchase Price** (100% settlement price), **Purchase Date** (settlement date, not PSA effective date, assignment date or recording date; record the recording date separately), **Total SF**, **Year Built** if a survey or appraisal states it.
3. **Ownership basis:** the closing documents give price at 100%. If ORA's share is below 100% (JV), enter price at 100% and state the share in Notes; never enter a share-adjusted price into the price field.
4. If a field is blank or disagrees with the closing document, write the document value and log Source A / Source B / value used in the manifest's Open items (or a Provenance table). A settlement statement beats a review memo, an OM and the NOI sheet.
5. **Do not overwrite a field that the page itself documents as an unresolved conflict** (a verification log saying "left unchanged, awaiting settlement statement") unless the package contains that exact statement. If it does, resolve the note and cite the file.
6. A price that cannot be split across register rows (portfolio purchases) stays blank; put the portfolio price and allocation basis in Notes.
7. Report each change in the hand-off as field, old value, new value, source file. Never change a field the user told you to leave alone.

---

## STAGE 7 — QC GATE

Do not report completion until all thirteen pass:

1. Every uploaded file is archived — including unparseable binaries.
2. File counts match, source vs archive vs mirror.
3. Every SHA-256 matches; the match is stated explicitly.
4. Counterparty filenames are byte-identical to what was received.
5. ORA artifacts follow the model / session-output schemas.
6. Every bucket exists; `archive/` exists.
7. No pre-existing folder for this deal was duplicated.
8. Manifest carries all six required sections.
9. Every dossier/IC-memo/model file citation resolves to a file on disk.
10. Sources-not-held section is populated (or explicitly "none").
11. Mirror verified at the destination, or its absence explained.
12. Deal memory and `MEMORY.md` index both updated.
13. Register reconciliation (Stage 6B) done or explicitly not applicable, with each change listed.

Then present the manifest and the dossier (if any) via the file-sharing tool, and state in two sentences: what was archived, and what remains open.

## FAILURE MODES SEEN IN PRACTICE

- **Renaming broker files to fit a schema** — silently orphans every citation in the underwrite. Preserve originals.
- **Trusting `Copy-Item` on long paths** — partial copy, no obvious error until you count files.
- **Verifying with `Get-ChildItem "\\?\..."`** — returns zero, reads as success, proves nothing.
- **Archiving the files but not the live sources** — the GIS pull, the broker e-mail, the market report. Six weeks later nobody can reconstruct where a figure came from.
- **A second folder for the same asset** — two partial archives, neither authoritative. Always search first.
- **Treating an OCR copy as a replacement** — keep both the image-only original and the OCR copy; the original is the executed instrument.
- **Register left blank or stale after closing** — prices, dates and share basis drift from the settlement statement and later feed the back-test with wrong inputs. Run Stage 6B.
