# Owner Outreach — Oxford Realty Advisors off-market cold-outreach pipeline (v1.4)

Weekly refresh of the T1 (first-touch) owner-outreach cycle: off-market master → queue → Notion dedup →
letter pack. Three scripts live in the project folder and do the real work — this skill's job is to run
them in the right order, in the right mode, and to stop at the right point.

**Outbound counterparty communication — DRAFT ONLY.** Per Hard Invariant 1, nothing in this pipeline is
ever sent without Gabriel's explicit in-turn confirmation. A scheduled run produces a drafted, reviewable
letter pack plus a Notion create-pages payload staged for the agent to push — never an auto-send.

## Scripts (fixed paths — the pipeline's actual location, not bundled resources)

All three live in `C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive - Oxford Capital Partners\Business\Investment Candidates -- 2026\`
(path corrected 2026-08-14 -- this doc had dropped the `Business\` segment the scripts themselves fixed
on 2026-07-21):
`owner_outreach_queue.py`, `build_t1_letterpack.py`, `owner_outreach_weekly.py`. Run them from that
folder via `owner_outreach_weekly.py` (the orchestrator) — do not call the queue/letter scripts directly
except for debugging a single step. These are deliberately NOT bundled into this skill package: they are
tightly coupled to that project folder's live data (the off-market master, `owner-outreach-ledger.csv`,
`mailing-overrides.csv`, `principal-overrides.csv`, `mail-log.csv`, `target-markets.json`) and bundling a
copy would create exactly the kind of sync-drift this skill exists to prevent. If the scripts and this
SKILL.md ever disagree about behavior, the scripts are the source of truth — re-read them before acting
on a stale description here.

## Workflow

1. **Scan run:** `python owner_outreach_weekly.py` (no flags). Corrected 2026-08-14 -- this step
   previously (wrongly) documented `--strict-age` as always-on. Per the 2026-07-12 relax, the queue
   script's staleness check is **WARN-only by default**: a stale upstream off-market master (>7 days)
   prints loudly in stdout/the run summary but does not halt the run. Report a STALE flag plainly if it
   appears; it is expected, not a bug -- `--strict-age` still exists on the queue script directly for
   anyone who wants the hard halt back, but the weekly orchestrator no longer passes it.
   Every scan run also applies the 2026-08-14 cadence gate (below) automatically. `--wave-cap N` is
   **opt-in, not automatic** -- pass it explicitly (`python owner_outreach_weekly.py --wave-cap 50`)
   to cap the pack at the top-N eligible letters; omitted, the full eligible queue renders as before.
2. On success, it produces: a dated queue (`YYYYMMDD_Owner-Outreach-Queue_Phase1_v01.xlsx`), a net-new
   Notion payload (`_oo_netnew_pages.json`), and a letter pack
   (`YYYYMMDD_Owner-Outreach_T1-Letter-Pack_Phase1_v01.docx`) — the letter pack generation includes a
   built-in letter-count integrity check (compares the DOCX's letter count against the promoted
   Tier-0-ready count) and will itself hard-fail if they don't match; the weekly orchestrator now
   propagates that failure instead of reporting success on a broken pack.
3. **Notion stage (agent, not script):** read `_oo_netnew_pages.json` and create the net-new pages in the
   Notion Owner Outreach Queue DB via MCP. The script never writes to Notion directly.
4. **Commit:** once the Notion push succeeds, run `python owner_outreach_weekly.py --commit` to append
   those parcels to `owner-outreach-ledger.csv` so next week's dedup is correct. Do not commit before
   confirming the Notion push succeeded — a false commit will silently swallow real net-new parcels next
   week.
5. **Report:** route the run summary (rows scanned, promoted, net-new by market, RECOVER gaps, upstream
   master age, integrity-check result) to `ggoldberg@oxfordra.net` ONLY, per routing canon. **Do not**
   release or send the letter pack itself — that is a separate, explicit action Gabriel takes.

### Conversion report

The first weekly run of each calendar month writes `_oo_conversion_block.md` (T1/T2/T3/T4 response and
conversion rates off `log_outreach_response.py`'s log) and it is included in that run's summary email.
Below 10 logged responses the block opens with an INSUFFICIENT SAMPLE banner -- per-touch counts only,
no rate/trend claim. Read-only: it reports on the existing ladder and scoring, and changes nothing --
any scoring or ladder change from what it surfaces needs Gabriel's sign-off.

## Letter format contract (read before touching letter layout)

The letter's geometry -- margins, spacing, the signature gap, the letterhead block, what appears in
the signature footer -- is defined by **`ORA_OwnerOutreach-T1Letter_FormatSpec_v1.1.md`** and its
executable form **`t1_letter_format.py`**, both of which live beside the scripts in the project
folder. `build_t1_letterpack.py` is expected to import the module rather than carry layout literals.

**The generator is the template.** A saved letter pack DOCX does not govern anything. If Gabriel
asks to "save this pack as the master template for future letters," the deliverable is a patch to
`build_t1_letterpack.py` (plus a spec bump), not a filed DOCX -- say so rather than filing the file
and reporting done. This is a real failure mode: on 2026-08-24 a hand-corrected pack was nearly
saved as "the template" while the generator would have reverted every change on the next run.

Current contract in brief (full values in the spec):

- Page 8.5x11; margins top 1.50" / bottom 1.00" / sides 1.10". The 1.50" top clears the pre-printed
  letterhead band -- verify against physical stock before a run.
- EB Garamond 11 pt throughout. No typeset firm block in letterhead mode.
- Signature gap after "Sincerely," is 46 pt (920 twips), sized for a wet signature.
- Signature footer is name / firm / cell / email / web. **No street address.**
- One letter per page via `pageBreakBefore`, never a manual page break.
- `MAX_LINE_CHARS = 76`. Two overflow modes are guarded in code: `fit_re_line()` (Re: line wrap --
  property count is NOT the lever, rendered length is) and `split_address_block()` (Tier-0 mailing
  parse gluing a capacity phrase onto the street line). Per-letter spacing tightening is the last
  resort; never shrink the font, never tighten pack-wide.
- **`verify_pack()` is a mandatory post-generation gate**: renders the pack and asserts one
  salutation per letter page, not merely the right page count. Hard-fail on a problem, same severity
  as the letter-count integrity check.

## What changed 2026-07-11 (read before assuming old behavior)

The scripts were audited and patched against real defects found in the two manual runs (2026-06-15,
2026-06-22):
- Both scripts pointed at a OneDrive folder path with a stray `(1)` duplicate-folder suffix that does
  not exist on this machine — every run would have failed to even find the master file until fixed.
- `owner_outreach_queue.py`'s market-priority ranking only covered 4 of ORA's 9 target clusters
  (Cincinnati and Kansas City — both established/primary — silently ranked last). It now reads
  `target-markets.json` at run time (established clusters rank ahead of entry-phase), falling back to a
  corrected static list only if that file is unreadable.
- `owner_outreach_weekly.py`'s Notion-category `METROS` set was missing Kansas City and Cincinnati.
- The letter-pack signature block was signing "Oxford Capital" with no email — stale relative to the
  `communication-intelligence` standard (Gabriel Goldberg / Oxford Realty Advisors /
  ggoldberg@oxfordra.net, ratified 2026-07-08). Corrected; phone and street-address footer unchanged.
  (Street-address footer superseded 2026-08-24 -- the DC address is struck from the signature block;
  the pre-printed letterhead carries it. Kept as history, not current behavior.)
- The 2026-06-22 run silently re-processed a 12-day-stale master and reported an uninformative
  zero-net-new result instead of halting. `--strict-age` is now always passed by the orchestrator.
  (Superseded 2026-07-12 -- see below; this bullet is kept as history, not current behavior.)
- A real silent-corruption incident (2026-06-15 pack: PDF had 59 letters, the same-named DOCX re-saved
  four days later had 44) prompted the letter-count integrity check in step 2 above.

## What changed 2026-08-14

Four changes landed today; two are code, two are corrections to this doc which had drifted out of sync
with the scripts.

- **Cadence gate (code, earlier today via Cowork).** The pack previously rendered the FULL current queue
  every scan, so a weekly release re-mailed every owner (the 07-13/21/27 packs were identical).
  `owner_outreach_weekly.py` now tracks actual mail events in `mail-log.csv` (populated by
  `python owner_outreach_weekly.py --released [YYYY-MM-DD]`, run after Gabriel physically mails a pack)
  and holds any parcel mailed within the last 21 days (`MIN_TOUCH_GAP_DAYS`) out of the next pack via
  `build_t1_letterpack.py --exclude`. `_oo_pack_manifest.json` records exactly which parcels a given pack
  contains, so `--released` logs the right set. `mail-log.csv` starts empty -- Gabriel must seed it with
  any packs physically mailed before 2026-08-14 or that history is unknown to the gate.
  **Scan guard (new):** the weekly scan now HALTs (exit 3) if the last built pack was never recorded
  with `--released` -- a built-but-unlogged pack means the cadence gate cannot know what was actually
  mailed, so the scan refuses to build another one on top of it. Override with `--rebuild-unreleased`
  only when Gabriel confirms the prior pack was genuinely never mailed and should be superseded.
  **`--released DATE --manifest PATH` records a pack mailed but never logged.** Note that
  `_oo_pack_manifest.json` lists parcels *before* the institutional-mail exclusion is applied, so a
  manifest read straight off that file can overstate who was actually mailed; the `--released` path now
  WARNs when called without an explicit `--manifest`. For a backfill, rebuild the manifest first:
  `python reconstruct_pack_manifest.py PACK.docx QUEUE.xlsx --out _oo_manifest_YYYYMMDD.json`
  (all-or-nothing; halts on any unmatched address), then pass that file as `--manifest`.
  **2026-09-22 incident:** the 08-24 pack was built but never `--released`, so the cadence gate held
  the same 50 parcels out of rotation and the 09-02/09-07/09-14 packs were regenerated with the
  identical 50 parcels every week. The set was mailed once; the scan guard above and
  `reconstruct_pack_manifest.py` were added in response. Backfilled as released 2026-09-02.
- **Named salutations (code).** `principal-overrides.csv` (beside `mailing-overrides.csv`; columns
  `parcel_id, salutation_name, confidence, source, verified_date`; hand/agent-maintained from the
  recorder worksheet + Notion Principals DB, never auto-resolved) now drives the letter salutation.
  `Verified`/`Probable` confidence renders `Dear {salutation_name},`; everything else falls back to
  `Dear Owner of {SiteAddress},`. The generic `Dear Property Owner` salutation is retired -- if it ever
  appears in a saved pack, the letter script hard-fails, same severity as the letter-count integrity
  check.
- **`--wave-cap N` (code).** `build_t1_letterpack.py --wave-cap N` and `owner_outreach_weekly.py
  --wave-cap N` (passthrough) cap a pack at the top-N eligible letters by Screen Score (tiebreak P1 %) --
  sized for the ~50/week hand-addressing budget. Deferred rows are reported on the cover page as
  "Deferred (wave cap)", distinct from cadence-held rows, and the same cap is applied when writing
  `_oo_pack_manifest.json` so the manifest matches what was actually rendered. Opt-in, not automatic.
- **Doc corrections (this file only, no code change).** The `Scripts` path above was missing the
  `Business\` segment the scripts themselves corrected on 2026-07-21, and step 1 above wrongly described
  `--strict-age` as still always-on after the 2026-07-12 relax to WARN-only. Both fixed today.

T3/T4 render via `--touch 3|4` (live since 2026-08-16). T2 is a call:
`build_t2_callsheet.py` runs every weekly scan and writes
`YYYYMMDD_Owner-Outreach_T2-CallSheet_v01.xlsx` (ratified call slice, ranked by Score then Motivation);
outcomes are logged with `log_outreach_response.py`. The call slice's size and cadence are read from
`outreach-ratification.json` (OR-2026-001) -- `ladder.cadence_days.t2` (days from T1 to the T2 call) and
`ladder.t2_call_slice.per_week_max` (weekly call cap) -- never hardcoded here.

**Still pending (not done, don't assume otherwise):** a full v2.0 rewrite of this doc (Gabriel's own
change list also calls for dropping the version to a clean "v2.0" once landed). Blocked on source files
Gabriel has not yet provided in-session -- verify it still says "pending" before assuming it shipped.

## What changed 2026-08-24

Letter format was corrected by hand against a live pack (156 letters, run date restamped to
August 26) and the result was ratified as a spec. No pipeline logic changed; this is layout plus a
new integrity gate.

- **Format spec + module (new).** `ORA_OwnerOutreach-T1Letter_FormatSpec_v1.1.md` and
  `t1_letter_format.py` now hold the letter's geometry. The generator is expected to import the
  module; until it does, every run reverts to the 2026-08-14 layout.
- **Signature footer.** DC street address struck. Letterhead carries it.
- **Margins.** Top 0.95" -> 1.50" (clears pre-printed letterhead art); bottom 0.95" -> 1.00".
- **Letterhead block.** The typeset firm name + tagline are dropped in `LETTERHEAD_MODE =
  "letterhead"`, the production default, because they collide with pre-printed stock. A "plain"
  mode retains them for plain-paper runs.
- **Signature gap.** 24 pt -> 46 pt for a wet signature.
- **Two overflow modes found and guarded.** Five letters spilled to a second page. Four were Re:-line
  wraps; the existing "(+N more) past three properties" cap did not prevent them, because three long
  addresses still render past the 76-character budget. One was an address-block wrap caused by the
  Tier-0 mailing parse emitting `<name> CO Trustees Et Al <street>` as a single 82-character field --
  a mailing-quality defect that would have printed badly in a window envelope regardless.
- **`verify_pack()` (new gate).** Page count alone passes when one letter spills and another is
  short; the new gate checks one salutation per letter page and named all five broken letters.

## Guardrails

- Letter layout is spec-governed, not file-governed -- see "Letter format contract" above.
  Never treat a saved pack as the template, and never hand-edit a pack's layout as a substitute
  for patching the generator; the next run will silently undo it.
- This skill now covers the full T1--T4 outreach ladder (T1 letters, T2 call slice, T3/T4 renders), not
  T1 alone. Second-stage conversation structures (extended-1031-study leaseback, installment sale/seller
  carry, objection handling) are documented in
  `2026-06-15_Owner-Outreach_Creative-Structures-and-Objections_v01.md` in the project folder and are
  NOT encoded in this skill — treat that file as the playbook once a letter or call gets a response,
  don't improvise past it.
- Standard firm name in outbound mail is "Oxford Realty Advisors" (current as of 2026-07-08) — verify
  this hasn't moved again against `communication-intelligence`'s signature-block canon before a live
  run, the same way the 2026-06-15 draft went stale on this exact point.
- `mailing-overrides.csv` and `principal-overrides.csv` are live, hands-on-keyboard patch files
  (address recovery and named salutations respectively) — treat entries there as authoritative
  overrides, never auto-resolved or auto-generated.
- Never fabricate a mailing address, an owner name, or a salutation name/confidence. Rows without a
  verified mailing address are reported as `[RECOVER]` and skipped from the letter pack, not guessed at;
  rows without a `Verified`/`Probable` `principal-overrides.csv` entry fall back to the generic
  address-anchored salutation, never an invented name.

## Known remaining gap (flag, don't silently fix)

No automated trigger yet forces the upstream off-market master (`AllMarkets-OffMarket-Master`) to
refresh on a cadence that keeps this skill's weekly run meaningful — that refresh is
`parcel-data-recovery`/`acquisition-underwriting` off-market screening territory, out of this skill's
scope. Until that's addressed, expect this pipeline to legitimately halt most weeks on a stale-master
FATAL rather than produce a queue. Report the halt and the master's age plainly rather than working
around it.

## Changelog

- v1.4 (2026-09-22): T2 call sheet (`build_t2_callsheet.py`, ratified call slice from `outreach-ratification.json` -- `ladder.cadence_days.t2` / `ladder.t2_call_slice.per_week_max`) and T3/T4 rendering (`--touch 3|4`, live since 2026-08-16) documented; "Still pending" note retired accordingly. Added the scan guard: the weekly scan HALTs (exit 3) if the last built pack was never `--released`, override `--rebuild-unreleased`. Documented `reconstruct_pack_manifest.py` for backfilling a manifest before a late `--released --manifest` call, and that `_oo_pack_manifest.json` lists parcels before the institutional-mail exclusion (the `--released` path now WARNs without an explicit `--manifest`). Logged the 2026-09-22 incident: the unreleased 08-24 pack caused the 09-02/09-07/09-14 packs to regenerate the same 50 parcels; mailed once, backfilled as released 2026-09-02. Added the "Conversion report" subsection (`_oo_conversion_block.md`, first weekly run of each month, INSUFFICIENT SAMPLE banner below 10 responses). Corrected the Guardrails line that called this the "T1 (first-touch) stage only" -- the skill now covers the full T1-T4 ladder.
- v1.3 (2026-08-24): Added the "Letter format contract" section and a matching guardrail -- letter geometry now points at `ORA_OwnerOutreach-T1Letter_FormatSpec_v1.1.md` / `t1_letter_format.py`, and the generator (not a saved DOCX) is named as the template of record. Added "What changed 2026-08-24": signature-footer address struck, top margin 1.50", letterhead block dropped for pre-printed stock, 46 pt signature gap, two overflow modes guarded in code, and `verify_pack()` added as a mandatory post-generation gate. Marked the 2026-07-11 "street-address footer unchanged" bullet superseded. No pipeline logic, cadence-gate behavior, or trigger vocabulary changed.
- v1.2 (2026-08-15): LOW fix (Skill Text Audit finding F9). Moved the v1.1/v1.0 changelog prose that had accumulated in the frontmatter `description` field down here — this is the first `## Changelog` heading in this file (the existing "What changed 2026-07-11" / "What changed 2026-08-14" sections above remain as the detailed operational history; this section is the short version-tag log matching other skills' convention). Description now carries a single trailing version tag. No pipeline logic, cadence-gate behavior, or trigger vocabulary changed.
- v1.1 (2026-08-14): Cadence gate (`mail-log.csv` / `MIN_TOUCH_GAP_DAYS`), named salutations (`principal-overrides.csv`), and `--wave-cap N` landed; `Scripts` path and `--strict-age` doc description corrected. v2.0 rewrite and T2-T4 multi-touch rendering still pending. Full detail: "What changed 2026-08-14" above.
- v1.0 (2026-07-11): Built from the three project scripts; audited and patched against defects found in the 2026-06-15/2026-06-22 manual runs. Full detail: "What changed 2026-07-11" above.
