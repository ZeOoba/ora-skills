## EXECUTION SEQUENCE

When this skill is triggered, execute in this order:

### Step 1 — Determine what's due this month

```
Current month: [MONTH YEAR]
Quarterly month (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct)?   [YES → include Cat 8 AMF]
Tax RowIDs due this month:           [from Cat 10 schedule]
Insurance renewal RowIDs this month: [from Cat 9 schedule]
Restoration Church Trust balloon:    [months to 2/20/2027; refinance status]
```

### Step 2 — Generate prioritized checklist
For each item due:
```
☐ [RowID] — [Item Name]
   System: [QB entity / PM platform / HubSpot / bank]
   Steps: [numbered sub-steps]
   Downstream if missed: [consequence]
   Est. time: [X min]
```
Execution order: Cat 1 → Cat 2 → Cat 3 → Cat 8 (if quarterly) → Cat 4 → Cat 5 → Cat 9 → Cat 10 → Cat 6 → Cat 7

### Step 3 — Check Notion for in-progress status
Query Notion Operations Hub (DB: 32b6ecd8) for last month's "Monthly Close" page. Identify any items NOT marked complete. Flag as "CARRIED FORWARD — INCOMPLETE FROM [PRIOR MONTH]" at top of this month's checklist.

### Step 4 — Track completion
As Gabriel confirms items complete, mark ✅ with timestamp. Flag any item incomplete by end of 1st business day.
