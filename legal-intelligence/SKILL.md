# Legal Intelligence — Oxford Realty Advisors (v1.4)

## MODULE 1: DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION

When a legal document is uploaded, immediately classify it as one of:

- **Lease** — commercial, industrial, retail, office, ground, or solar
- **Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA)**
- **Loan document** — promissory note, deed of trust, guaranty, loan application (a final loan document, assumption agreement, carry-back note or lender consent also takes the `debt-management` Term-Sheet Redline step 0 re-test on the final principal before signature, per the INTERIM checklist and Gabriel's pending-position ledger in `debt-management/references/ltv-interim-netting-checklist.md`; an executed payoff letter or closing statement is the document Gabriel cites when he enters a reduction or marks a row booked)
- **Estoppel certificate**
- **SNDA** — Subordination, Non-Disturbance, and Attornment agreement
- **Vendor/service contract**
- **Amendment or addendum** to an existing agreement (an operating-agreement amendment, contribution agreement or other agreement that sells, contributes or changes Oxford's share of an asset also takes the `debt-management` INTERIM aggregate-LTV test before signature and a proposed pending-position ledger row, per `debt-management/references/ltv-interim-netting-checklist.md`)
- **Letter of Intent (LOI)**
- **Title commitment / title insurance policy** — handled HERE (this skill) at the clause level, with `deal-execution` coordinating closing context when the commitment surfaces inside an active DD workflow. Review structure: verify Schedule A (insured, estate, amount, effective date, vesting) against the PSA; cross-walk every Schedule B-I requirement to a responsible party and cure path; classify each Schedule B-II exception as CTC (clear to close), NEG (negotiate/endorse over), or WALK (deal-threatening); and assemble the ALTA endorsement-request list. Output: XLSX exception matrix + DOCX endorsement-request letter per ORA institutional standards. *(v1.1, 2026-06-11: the former deferral to a `title-commitment-redline` skill is removed — that skill was scaffolded 2026-05-15 but never installed on any surface; verified absent 2026-06-09 audit and re-verified 2026-06-11.)*

State the document type at the top of every analysis before proceeding.

## MODULE 2: LEASE REVIEW FRAMEWORK

For any commercial lease, extract and analyze the following in order:

### ECONOMICS
- Base rent schedule with all escalations: annual %, CPI, fixed dollar, or market reset
- Lease type classification: NNN, modified gross, gross, or percentage rent
- CAM structure: pro rata, base year stop, or fixed CAM with annual escalation cap
- Tenant improvement allowance: amount, disbursement conditions, amortization if early termination
- Free rent or concession periods
- Security deposit: dollar amount vs. monthly rent ratio
- Calculate rent PSF annually for the entire lease term — present as a schedule table

### TERM & OPTIONS
- Initial term: commencement date, expiration date, term length
- Extension options: count, length per option, notice period required, rate reset mechanism
- Early termination rights: trigger conditions, notice period, termination penalty (typically 6 months' rent + unamortized TI)
- Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on adjacent space or on purchase of property
- Right of First Offer (ROFO): trigger, offer period, strike price mechanics
- Holdover provisions: rate (flag if not explicitly 150% or higher), tenancy type created

### RISK PROVISIONS
- **Personal guaranty:** present/absent, full vs. limited scope, burn-off schedule, corporate vs. individual
- **Assignment and subletting:** consent standard (sole discretion vs. not unreasonably withheld), profit sharing, landlord recapture right
- **Default provisions:** monetary cure period, non-monetary cure period, notice requirements, landlord remedies (termination, acceleration, re-entry, damages)
- **Insurance requirements:** minimum coverages, additional insured language, waiver of subrogation, 30-day cancellation notice
- **Indemnification:** mutual vs. one-sided, cross-indemnity carve-outs, survival period post-lease
- **Environmental:** tenant vs. landlord responsibility for contamination, pre-existing condition carve-outs, survival
- **Casualty and condemnation:** termination triggers (threshold % of damage), restoration obligations, rent abatement during restoration, allocation of condemnation awards
- **Subordination:** automatic vs. conditional, SNDA requirement, non-disturbance protections for tenant

### LANDLORD-SPECIFIC CONCERNS (Gabriel's history-derived)
Flag each of the following if present:
- ⚠️ Below-market rent — compare to Oxford portfolio comps and stated market rates
- ⚠️ Related-party or self-dealing terms — tenant-favorable provisions without market justification
- ⚠️ Extension notice period shorter than 9 months — risk of inadvertent holdover
- ⚠️ No mark-to-market reset at extension — locks landlord into below-market rent for option term
- ⚠️ Structural maintenance allocated to landlord — quantify roof/HVAC/structure CapEx exposure
- ⚠️ Memorandum of lease provisions that conflict with lease body (per 1333 REDACTED-112 precedent)
- ⚠️ No explicit COI expiration tracking obligation on tenant
- ⚠️ ROFR or purchase option that would impair lender financing or future sale

---

## MODULE 3: PSA REVIEW FRAMEWORK

For any Purchase and Sale Agreement:

### KEY TERMS EXTRACT
- Purchase price, deposit amount, deposit structure (hard/soft, phasing)
- Due diligence period: length, start trigger, extension rights, termination right
- Closing date: target, outside closing date, extension rights and costs
- Representations and warranties: survival period, materiality qualifiers, knowledge qualifiers
- Closing conditions: title, survey, tenant estoppels, SNDA, environmental
- Prorations: rent, taxes, CAM, security deposits — proration date and mechanics
- Assignment rights: can Oxford assign to an affiliated entity pre-closing?

### CRITICAL PROVISIONS (Gabriel's history-derived — hold firm on all three)
- **Willful default carve-out:** Seller must not be able to simply walk away on a default — ensure seller's deposit obligation or specific performance remedy is available for willful default
- **Memorandum of contract recording right:** Oxford's right to record notice of contract in public record as cloud against title
- **MAC clause:** Material Adverse Change provision giving Oxford termination right if material adverse change to property between execution and closing

**Check these three by their operative language, not by section number, and check them on OUTBOUND drafts as well as inbound.** They are ORA-added rather than template-native, so nothing in the underlying document complains when they are missing — they disappear far more often through an ORA-side drafting round than through a seller deletion. Where the document is a PSA in an active deal, this check belongs to `deal-execution` Workflow 2B; run it there rather than duplicating it.

### PSA RED FLAGS
- Seller representations limited to "actual knowledge" without deemed knowledge of property manager
- No representation on pending litigation or code violations
- Environmental indemnity carved out entirely
- Tenant estoppel threshold below 85% of in-place NNN rent
- Missing cross-default between PSA and any related documents (seller leaseback, etc.)

## MODULE 4: CLAUSE LIBRARY

Oxford's preferred clause language for key provisions:

### RENT ESCALATION
- **Standard fixed:** 3.0% annual increase on each anniversary of commencement date
- **CPI-based:** Greater of 2.0% or CPI-U (All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average), capped at 4.0%
- **Market reset at extension:** FMV determined by independent MAI appraisal; if parties cannot agree within 30 days, each selects an appraiser, the two appraisers select a third, and the median of three appraisals controls

### DEFAULT AND REMEDY
- Monetary default cure period: 5 calendar days after written notice
- Non-monetary default cure period: 30 days after written notice (extended for diligent cure in progress)
- Late fee: 5% of overdue amount after 5-day grace period
- Interest on overdue amounts: lesser of 18% per annum or maximum rate permitted by law
- Landlord remedies on default: termination of lease + acceleration of all remaining rent + repossession + actual damages + attorneys' fees

### ENVIRONMENTAL
- Tenant bears full liability for all environmental conditions caused or contributed to by tenant or tenant's agents
- Landlord bears responsibility for pre-existing environmental conditions documented in Phase I/II at execution
- Mutual indemnification with 3-year survival period post-lease expiration

### INSURANCE MINIMUMS (Oxford standard)
- Commercial General Liability: $1,000,000 per occurrence / $2,000,000 aggregate
- Property / Casualty: replacement cost value of all tenant improvements and personal property
- Workers' Compensation: statutory limits; Employer's Liability: $500,000
- Umbrella / Excess Liability: $5,000,000 per occurrence
- Oxford named as additional insured on all policies
- 30-day advance written notice of cancellation or material change
- Certificates provided to Oxford within 10 days of policy inception and annually thereafter

### PERSONAL GUARANTY
- **Full guaranty option:** Full, unconditional, irrevocable personal guaranty of all lease obligations for the full term
- **Burn-off option:** Full guaranty for first 24 months; burns off if no uncured monetary default as of month 24
- **Rolling option:** Guaranty covering next 12 months of base rent, rolling forward monthly; no burn-off

### ASSIGNMENT / SUBLETTING
- Landlord consent required; consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed (30-day response window)
- Landlord receives 50% of any sublease premium above base rent (after deducting tenant's reasonable transaction costs)
- Landlord retains recapture right for any proposed assignment: may terminate lease and re-lease space directly within 30 days of tenant's assignment request

---

## MODULE 5: COUNTERPARTY PATTERN RECOGNITION

### KING ENERGY (solar leases)
Historical pattern — King Energy pushes for:
- Unilateral ITC (Investment Tax Credit) termination right if NTP (Notice to Proceed) not reached by specified date
- Extended recoupment window (standard 5 years → requests 10 years)
- Reduced Site Access Fee caps in later years

Oxford should push back on:
- Expansion of security safeguarding duty beyond standard reasonable care
- Rent deferral beyond Year 5 of operations
- NTP deadlines without corresponding King Energy diligence obligations (they cannot trigger termination by failing to obtain permits)
- Broad force majeure that covers ITC policy changes

### SELLER'S COUNSEL ON PSAs
Common deletion attempts — HOLD FIRM on all three:
1. Willful default carve-out (do not remove)
2. Memorandum of contract recording right (do not remove)
3. MAC clause (do not remove)

### SMALL INDUSTRIAL TENANTS
Common tenant pushback areas:
- Personal guaranty (can concede burn-off but not full waiver for new tenants)
- CAM reconciliation transparency (can concede annual statement; cannot concede audit right)
- Insurance minimums (can reduce umbrella to $2M for small tenants; cannot waive additional insured)

Oxford can offer without significant risk:
- Minor TI allowance ($3-5/SF for paint/carpet)
- 1 month free rent on new leases (not renewals)
- Flexible move-in timing (2-4 week window)

## MODULE 6: DOCUMENT COMPARISON ENGINE

### Step 0 — Establish how revisions are encoded (run FIRST, every time)

A marked-up document arrives in one of three encodings, and only the first is what "tracked changes" means:

| Encoding | How it looks in the XML |
|---|---|
| **OOXML tracked changes** | `<w:ins>` / `<w:del>` elements, with author and date |
| **Compare-tool formatting** | NO `<w:ins>`/`<w:del>` at all — revisions are ordinary runs carrying strikethrough (deletions) and coloured underline (insertions), produced by Litera Compare / DeltaView / Change-Pro, Workshare Compare, or Word's own Compare Documents |
| **Clean** | No revisions of any kind |

**Never conclude "no changes" from the absence of `<w:ins>`/`<w:del>`.** On a compare-tool file that test returns zero and the correct answer is "twenty-nine changes." Underlining alone does not identify insertions either — section headings and hyperlinks are underlined and frequently coloured, so treating "underlined and coloured" as an insertion reports a clean document as a redline. A compare output is identified by the presence of strikethrough *deletions*; colours vary by vendor and Litera's red/blue is not universal.

Counsel COMMENTS are a fourth case and are equally invisible to a tracked-change parse: they live in `word/comments.xml`, so a commented-but-unrevised draft reads as clean.

**Detection is owned by the `deal-execution` skill.** Invoke its Workflow 2 Step 0 (`scripts/extract_revisions.py`), which detects all four cases, reports every encoding present when a document carries more than one, and hard-stops when a file reads clean but its name or content says it should not. Do not reimplement the detection here and do not reference the script by relative path — the two skills install independently, so `deal-execution`'s files are not reachable from this one at runtime. If `deal-execution` is not installed on the current surface, say so rather than guessing at the encoding by eye.

**Read the compare-tool summary block first when one is present.** It names the BASE document the counterparty compared against and gives the tool's own change tally. The base is what determines which provisions were *accepted* as opposed to merely uncommented — and if it names anything other than the draft ORA actually sent, the counterparty reviewed stale paper and the round must be re-based before any analysis. Cite the tool's tally externally, not the script's run counts; the two count differently and the tool's number is the one opposing counsel will quote.

> Origin: 2026-07-31, 754 Old State Route 74 — seller's counsel delivered a Litera Compare output with 0 tracked changes and 29 real revisions.

### Then produce the comparison

1. Produce a structured discrepancy table in this format:
   | Section | Version A Language | Version B Language | Classification | Beneficiary | Oxford Impact |
   |---------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|

2. Classify each discrepancy:
   - **Material** — changes rights, obligations, economics, or risk allocation
   - **Minor** — clarifying language only, no substantive change
   - **Drafting Error** — appears to be an unintentional inconsistency or omission

3. Identify which party benefits from each change (Landlord / Tenant / Neutral)

4. Flag any provision that contradicts another recorded document (title commitment, memorandum of lease, prior amendment, recorded easement)

5. Produce executive summary: total discrepancy count, material vs. minor breakdown, top 3 issues requiring resolution, recommended negotiation strategy

6. Output format: offer both inline markdown table AND .docx file via document-assembly skill

7. **State the detected encoding at the top of the comparison output**, alongside the document type from Module 1. A reader must be able to tell whether "no changes in Article 8" means the counterparty left it alone or means the parse never saw the changes.

## Changelog

- v1.4 (2026-10-26): Module 1 loan-document bullet points to the `debt-management` v1.6 Term-Sheet step 0 final-principal aggregate-LTV re-test under the INTERIM checklist and pending-position ledger, and names the payoff letter or closing statement as the document Gabriel cites for a reduction or booking; the amendment bullet sends share-changing agreements (operating-agreement amendments, contribution agreements) to the same test (pointer only; no review rule changed). No governor constant changed (DSCR 1.25x; 40% aggregate; 65% per-property).
- v1.3 (2026-08-21, adversarial review): "estoppel"/"SNDA" triggers (frontmatter description and TRIGGER PHRASES)
  narrowed to clause-analysis-only, with an explicit pointer to `estoppel-request-generation` for drafting/generating a
  certificate — the two skills previously claimed the identical bare trigger words with no tie-break, risking a "draft
  the estoppels" request routing here instead of to the purpose-built skill.
- v1.2 (2026-08-01): Module 6 gains **Step 0 — revision-encoding detection**, run before any comparison. The engine implicitly assumed OOXML tracked changes; Litera Compare / Workshare / Word-compare outputs contain none and encode revisions as strikethrough and coloured-underline formatting, so the prior approach returned "no changes" on a fully redlined document (754 Old State Route 74, 2026-07-31 — 0 tracked changes, 29 real revisions). Step 0 routes to `deal-execution/scripts/extract_revisions.py`, requires the compare summary's BASE document be read and validated against what ORA actually sent, and warns that underline alone does not identify insertions (headings are underlined too — the discriminator is an explicit non-neutral colour, derived from the document's own palette). New Module 6 output rule 7: state the detected encoding alongside the document type. Module 3's three critical provisions now carry an instruction to check them by operative language and on OUTBOUND drafts, deferring to `deal-execution` Workflow 2B in an active deal.
- v1.1 (2026-06-11): dead title-commitment-redline deferral removed; title commitments handled in-skill.
