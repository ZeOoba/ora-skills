addendum_qc.py -- QC gate for ORA lease addenda (lease-addendum skill v1.0)

Usage: python3 addendum_qc.py <addendum.docx|pdf> [more ...] [--allow-tokens] [--m3b] [--m4]
                              [--state ST]

Exit 0 = no BLOCK-severity failures across all readable files.
Exit 1 = at least one BLOCK found on a readable file (takes priority over exit 2 even if
         another file in the same run was unreadable -- there is a real, actionable defect).
Exit 2 = a file could not be read to at least 150 words and got no QC result at all.
Severity is BLOCK / HIGH / MED / LOW, same convention as lease-form-qc/scripts/lease_qc.py.

Pattern (zip + regex over word/document.xml, no python-docx dependency for scanning) and the
(id, severity, label, test) check-tuple convention are ported directly from
lease-form-qc/scripts/lease_qc.py -- see that script for the source of the text_of() shape.

--m3b flags this run as a tenant-substitution/novation addendum, which turns on checks 4, 5, 6,
11, 12, 16 (the M3b package) as BLOCK-severity even when the document doesn't self-declare a
substitution (the acceptance-test failure mode this gate exists to catch is exactly a
substitution that was drafted -- and therefore reads -- as if it were a ministerial name change).

WHAT THE ora_doc_qc RETROFIT CHANGED
-------------------------------------
This file's former text_of() was unconditional `zipfile.ZipFile(path)` -- no format branch at
all. A PDF (or any non-.docx path) raised an uncaught zipfile.BadZipFile, crashing the whole run
at exit code 1 -- indistinguishable, at the exit code, from "found a real BLOCK-severity defect".
There was also no word-count floor, so a near-empty .docx ran all 16 checks against a handful of
words instead of being flagged as unreadable. Same root cause as the false-clean/false-BLOCK bugs
ora_doc_qc.py was extracted to fix in pma-qc/listing-agreement-qc/lease-form-qc (no real format
detection before applying a format-specific parser to file bytes), a third failure shape: a hard
crash rather than a false result. extract() now does real format detection, tries pdftotext then
OCR for a PDF, and returns UNREADABLE (exit 2) for anything that will not yield 150 words.
Verified in tests/test_addendum_qc.py against a synthetic no-text-layer PDF fixture and a
near-empty DOCX fixture.

Checks 2 and 3 (the rent-schedule row parser, _rent_rows) read ctx["raw"] -- the shared module's
un-normalized body text -- not ctx["t"]. ora_doc_qc.norm() collapses all whitespace, newlines
included, and _rent_rows() depends on each table cell landing on its own line. ctx["t"] would
silently zero out every parsed row, a silent false-negative in exactly the checks that verify
rent-schedule arithmetic -- the same class of pitfall lease-form-qc's A2 hit with its re.M anchor.
Pinned by tests/test_addendum_qc.py::TestRentTableParity against a frozen copy of the pre-retrofit
line-based parser.

Check 9 (ordinal consistency) previously depended on a `[[CORE_TITLE]] <title>` marker that
text_of() spliced onto the body, then re-parsed back out with a regex -- the same pattern that
caused lease-form-qc's F18 to trip on its own `[[FOOTER]]` marker (this one happened not to
collide with TOKEN_RE, since TOKEN_RE's character class lacks '_', but that was luck, not design).
It now reads a cleanly-extracted `ctx["core_title"]` (via the local _docx_title() helper, mirroring
how ora_doc_qc.extract() already reads dc:creator/Company from the same docProps/core.xml part)
instead of re-parsing a marker out of scanned text. The title text is still appended to ctx["t"]
(unmarked) so check 14's token scan keeps the same coverage of metadata-embedded tokens it had
before.
