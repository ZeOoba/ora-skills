## SCHEDULED TASKS TO VERIFY

**Canonical source = the live registries, not any table in this file.** At the start of every run, call `list_scheduled_tasks` (LAMS/Cowork fleet) and read the CC fleet store (`~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/`) to enumerate enabled tasks; verify THOSE, live, every time. Any hardcoded task list — including the snapshot below — goes stale and is illustrative only.

> ILLUSTRATIVE SNAPSHOT — LAMS/Cowork fleet, pulled via `list_scheduled_tasks` 2026-07-08 (20 tasks; NOT authoritative, re-pull at execution time):
> `ora-consolidate-memory-monthly` (05:00, day 2 monthly) · `ora-skill-store-drift-check` (Mon 12:10 PM) · `ora-skill-text-audit` (10:00 AM, day 15 monthly) · `ora-om-intake-ocr` (Wed 6:15 AM) · `ora-owner-outreach-queue-refresh` (Mon ~10:00 AM) · `ora-passed-deal-tracker` (06:30, day 15 monthly) · `efulton-post-legalhold-consolidation` (one-time 2026-07-12) · `ora-replacement-cost-refresh` (06:00, day 9 of Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec) · `ora-bearmode-refresh` (06:15, day 9 of Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec) · `ora-cam-reconciliation-annual` (07:00, Jan 15) · `ora-dashboard-refresh` (daily 07:00) · `ora-counsel-review-standard-positions` (one-time 2026-08-03) · `ora-friday-closeout` (Fri 4:30 PM) · `ora-lease-expiration-brief` (Mon 8:30 AM — cron `30 8 * * 1`) · `ora-monday-sync` (Mon 7:30 AM) · `ora-am-brief` (daily 6:00 AM) · `ora-cowork-heartbeat` (daily 05:50 + 17:50) · `automation-health-monitor` (weekdays 11:00 AM — this task) · `ora-stale-pipeline-nudge` (Thu 10:15 AM) · `ora-ar-export-freshness-nudge` (11:30 AM, day 1 & 15 monthly).
> CC/MCP fleet (~17 tasks per session context, e.g. `ora-financial-code-integrity-sweep`, `ora-master-workbook-ingest`, `ora-open-sessions-board`, `ora-pm-ledger`, `ora-week-ahead-briefing`, `ora-deal-sourcing-scan`) is NOT enumerable from a Cowork session — `~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/` is host-protected and not mountable here. Read it live from a Code-surface session.
> **Off-fleet substrates (added 2026-08-21, `open-items-tracker.md#OI-197`) — report-only, see Step 1.75.** The two fleet registries above are not the whole automation surface. Two more substrates run real ORA automation outside either registry and are invisible to a fleet-pause: (1) the native Windows Task Scheduler `ORA*` tasks — **9 as of 2026-08-24, and ENUMERATED not recited**: `ORA Command Center - Mirror Deploy`, `ORA Mirror Deploy Classifier`, `ORA Fleet Dead-Man`, `ORA Fleet Heartbeat Push`, `ORA Fleet Pause-Resume Guard`, `ORA Stuck-Session Watchdog`, `ORA Claude Desktop Wake-and-Launch`, `ORA Nightly Disk Clean`, `ORA PM Crons` (the last `Disabled` by design, see `ora-pm-daily-crons`). This list is a **diff baseline for Step 1.75, not a query filter** — it shipped 2026-08-21 naming seven, and a live enumeration on 2026-08-24 found two more that had been invisible since creation. Same hardcoded-roster failure as the fleet tables above, one layer down; (2) 2 GitHub Actions cron workflows in `ZeOoba/ora-cowork-watchdog` (`cowork-heartbeat.yml`, `health-guard-beacon.yml`). This closes the specific gap that let `ORA Command Center - Mirror Deploy` go unclassified during the 2026-08-17 fleet pause — its own classifier, `ora-command-center-mirror-drift-check`, is itself an on-fleet CC task and went dark with everything else.
>
> None of the previously hardcoded task names (Deal Intake Scanner, Lease Expiration Tracker, Delinquency Tracker, QB Export Processor, PM AR Aging Processor, Weekly Oxford Digest, Deal Sourcing Digest, HubSpot Pipeline Sync, Email Response Queue, `ora-weekly-sourcing-digest`, `ora-lease-expiration-dashboard`, `ora-weekly-tooling-intel-sweep`, `ora-hubspot-renewal-calendar`, `ora-broker-email-to-notion`, `ora-hubspot-note-to-interaction-log`, `ora-ar-aging-daily-sync`, `ora-dashboard-refresh`) match a live LAMS/Cowork task as of 2026-08-15 (`ora-dashboard-refresh` specifically: its `oxford-perfection` project root no longer exists and it cannot fire; the Pages target it once served is now handled by the native Windows Scheduled Task `deploy-mirror.ps1`, monitored by the live `ora-command-center-mirror-drift-check` — this is an architectural supersession, not a rename, per `memory/_archive` OI-025 sweep README, 2026-08-05) — the v1.1 changelog's claim that dynamic enumeration "replaces" this table was correct in intent but the table itself was never actually removed until this fix. Schedule-detail note: the retired table stated `ora-lease-expiration-brief` ran Monday 8:20 AM; live registration is `30 8 * * 1` (8:30 AM, displayed as 8:35 AM with scheduler jitter) — corrected here.

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step 1 — Determine which tasks should have run

Based on today's date and day of week, identify which of the LIVE-enumerated tasks (Step 0: `list_scheduled_tasks` + CC fleet read — not the illustrative snapshot above) were scheduled to have run today or since the last health check (yesterday 11:00 AM through today 11:00 AM).

### Step 1.25 — One-time tickler lifecycle check (added 2026-08-28, closes a false "stuck" alarm class)

Incident (2026-08-28): `ora-754-flaute-escalation-check`, a one-time CC/MCP tickler (fireAt 08:00 ET), was throttle-delayed ~1h41m by the AM catch-up burst, actually fired 09:41 ET, then auto-disabled per normal one-time completion. A fleet-status/setup-self-audit advisory snapshotted mid-delay — while the task was still enabled and pre-fire — correctly read "expired, not yet fired, still enabled" AT THAT INSTANT, but was forwarded and acted on minutes later, after the task had already completed. Read at face value, a disabled one-time task looks indistinguishable from a genuinely stuck one unless `lastRunAt` is checked.

Before treating ANY one-time task's `disabled` state (or a pasted fleet-status/setup-self-audit advisory naming one) as evidence of a miss, check `lastRunAt` against `fireAt`:

- **`enabled:false` + `lastRunAt` set** (at or after `fireAt`, however delayed) — a NORMAL one-time completion, throttle-delay included. Not a finding. Do not flag, do not draft a Gabriel alert.
- **`enabled:false` + `lastRunAt` NOT set** — genuinely anomalous (disabled without ever firing: manually paused, or a registry-write defect). Flag it.
- **`enabled:true` + past `fireAt`, not yet fired** — still pending, most likely mid AM-catch-up-burst throttle delay. Re-verify live (`fleet-status.py --json` or `list_scheduled_tasks`) rather than trusting a snapshot more than a few minutes old before flagging — `fleet-status.py`'s own report now carries a staleness warning for exactly this reason (v2026-08-28). Only escalate once it's overdue past a reasonable burst window, not the instant `fireAt` passes.

This mirrors `fleet-status.py`'s own `expired_needs_attention` filter, which already gets this right (`not lastRunAt OR enabled`) — the failure mode here isn't a logic bug in that filter, it's a downstream reader treating an old snapshot as still-current. Re-verify live before flagging OR before drafting any Gabriel alert for a one-time task.

### Step 1.5 — Model-currency check (both fleets, ℹ️ informational)

For each LIVE-enumerated task, verify its `[MODEL: ...]` tag. The current standard and the full mechanism live in `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/reference_scheduled_task_model_standard.md` — read its **Current standard** line at run time (do not hardcode a model id here). This check is ℹ️ **informational only** — it goes in the Notion status report, never a Gabriel alert email, because no forced-upgrade action exists (a model change is a manual disable→recreate cycle).

The two fleets are checked differently, because their model is settable in one and server-pinned in the other:

- **LAMS/Cowork tasks** — the model IS chosen at creation. Read the `[MODEL: <id> | set YYYY-MM-DD]` tag off each task's `description` (already returned by `list_scheduled_tasks` — no extra tool call). Flag `MODEL-STALE` any task whose `<id>` ≠ the current standard, or that carries no tag.
- **CC/MCP tasks** — the model is server-pinned and NOT settable (there is no model field to choose; see the reference doc's "NOT settable, but IS observable" note). So this is a **presence + observation-freshness** check, not a match-the-standard check. Read the `[MODEL: ...]` tag from each task's `~/.claude/scheduled-tasks/<id>/SKILL.md` frontmatter `description` (the same file you already read to enumerate enabled state). Flag ℹ️:
  - a CC/MCP task with **no `[MODEL]` tag at all** (the real gap — newer tasks were created without one);
  - a tag whose `checked YYYY-MM-DD` date is stale (older than the last model release / the release-check cadence in [[reference_model_release_checklist]]).
  - `[MODEL: UNVERIFIABLE | checked <recent-date>]` is ACCEPTABLE — it correctly documents the server-pinned limitation; only a stale or missing `checked` date is worth noting. A concrete id (e.g. `ora-cc-schematic-refresh`'s `[MODEL: claude-sonnet-5 | checked ...]`) is fine as an observation; do NOT flag it as "stale vs standard" (the model can't be forced on this fleet).

Report the counts in the Notion status page (e.g. "Model tags: LAMS 20/20 on standard; CC/MCP 13/19 tagged (12 UNVERIFIABLE, 1 id-pinned), 6 untagged — ℹ️").

### Step 1.75 — Enumerate the two off-fleet substrates (added 2026-08-21, OI-197 fix (b), report-only)

This absorbs OI-197's fix (b) — widen this skill instead of building a separate off-fleet classifier. **Read-only, Notion-report-only: this step must never register a new scheduled task, wire a new alert cadence, or otherwise create new unattended automation without Gabriel's explicit confirmation, even if it finds a real gap.**

**Windows Task Scheduler — ENUMERATE, don't recite a roster (v1.7, 2026-08-24).** This step used to hardcode seven task names. On 2026-08-24 a live enumeration returned **nine**: the list was missing `ORA Fleet Pause-Resume Guard` and `ORA Mirror Deploy Classifier`, both real, both `Ready`, both invisible to this skill since they were created. That is the identical hardcoded-roster failure v1.2 fixed for the *fleet* tables one layer up — and it is worse here, because a name absent from the list is not merely unreported, it is unreportable: nothing else on this machine watches these tasks. Sharper still, one of the two missing tasks was `ORA Fleet Pause-Resume Guard`, i.e. part of the pause machinery the same run spent most of its effort reasoning about.

**The canonical source is the live query. Run BOTH commands — `Get-ScheduledTaskInfo` does NOT emit `State`,** so the old single-pipeline `Select-Object ...,State,...` silently returned a blank column and nobody noticed:

```powershell
# 1. State (Ready / Disabled / Running) — from Get-ScheduledTask
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'ORA*' | Select-Object TaskName,State | Format-Table -AutoSize

# 2. Run history — from Get-ScheduledTaskInfo
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'ORA*' | Get-ScheduledTaskInfo |
  Select-Object TaskName,LastRunTime,LastTaskResult,NextRunTime | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

Report `State`/`LastRunTime`/`LastTaskResult`/`NextRunTime` per task, for **every** task the query returns.

**Diff the live set against the known roster and report BOTH directions** — that is what turns enumeration into detection:

| Known roster (as of 2026-08-24, 9 tasks) |
|---|
| `ORA Command Center - Mirror Deploy` · `ORA Mirror Deploy Classifier` · `ORA Fleet Dead-Man` · `ORA Fleet Heartbeat Push` · `ORA Fleet Pause-Resume Guard` · `ORA Stuck-Session Watchdog` · `ORA Claude Desktop Wake-and-Launch` · `ORA Nightly Disk Clean` · `ORA PM Crons` (Disabled by design) |

- **Live but not in the roster → `OFF-FLEET-UNTRACKED` (ℹ️).** New off-fleet automation nobody told this skill about. Report it with its state and schedule, and update the roster table above in the same pass — the table is a *diff baseline*, never an input filter.
- **In the roster but not live → `OFF-FLEET-DISAPPEARED` (⚠️).** A watchdog that has been deleted is the one case where silence really does mean something broke, and it is exactly the failure this substrate has no other detector for.

The roster table is deliberately a checked-against-reality baseline, not the query's `-TaskName` argument. Never narrow the query to the roster; that is what caused this fix. `ORA PM Crons` reading `Disabled` is expected (superseded by `ora-pm-daily-crons` on the CC/MCP fleet, OI-162) — not a finding. **Decode `LastTaskResult`, do not print the raw int as if it were self-evidently a failure:**
- `0x0` — success.
- `0xC000013A` — process terminated (e.g. killed mid-run); worth a look if recent.
- `0x8007042B` — the task terminated by Task Scheduler itself hitting a stop condition (e.g. `StopIfGoingOnBatteries`) — usually benign, note it, don't alarm.
- `0x00041301` (`SCHED_S_TASK_RUNNING`) — **still executing at query time. This is NOT a failure** — a task legitimately mid-run reads this way; flagging it as failed is exactly how this monitor would cry wolf.
- `1` where the *task's own script* uses exit code 1 as its "problems found, by design" convention (e.g. `fleet-deadman.ps1`, `cowork-heartbeat-check.py`'s alert-but-exit-0-usually path) — read that script's own documented exit-code meaning before treating `1` as a crash; several of these substrates use `1` deliberately to mean "alert posted successfully," not "run failed."

**GitHub Actions cron — `ZeOoba/ora-cowork-watchdog`.** Run (or have a Code-surface session run) `gh run list --workflow=cowork-heartbeat.yml --limit 3` and `gh run list --workflow=health-guard-beacon.yml --limit 3` (crons `0 */4 * * *` and `35 */4 * * *`). Report each workflow's most recent run status/conclusion/timestamp. A `failure` conclusion here means the watchdog itself (not the thing it watches) is broken — surface distinctly from a heartbeat-stale alert the watchdog successfully posted.

Report both substrates in the same Notion status page as Step 3, under their own subsection — do not fold their results into the fleet task-status table, since they aren't fleet tasks and a reader needs to know which substrate a row came from.

### Step 2 — Search Notion for evidence of execution

For each task that was scheduled to run in the check window:

- Use the Notion MCP to search for the expected output page
- Search by: task name as keyword, date created = today or yesterday
- Check that the page exists AND has a timestamp within the expected window
- Flag any task that should have produced output but has no matching page

### Step 3 — Post status report to Notion Operations Hub

Create or update a "Automation Health — \[Today's Date\]" page in the Notion Operations Hub with this format:

```
# Automation Health Check — [DATE] [TIME]

## Summary
[X of Y tasks verified ✅ | Z tasks flagged ⚠️/❌]

## Task Status
✅ [Task Name] — Last run: [timestamp] — Output: [page title/link]
⚠️ [Task Name] — MISSED: Expected [date/time], no output found
❌ [Task Name] — ERROR: [description of what went wrong]

## Actions Taken
[Any auto-remediation steps or notifications sent]
```

### Step 3.5 — Correlate against a known machine-offline window before alerting per-task

Incident (2026-07-10): the machine was offline ~10:15–11:00 ET. Two hourly `deploy-mirror.ps1`
runs each fired their own "Mirror deploy FAILED" email (queued in Outlook, both delivered at
11:07 when connectivity returned), and this task then added a THIRD, separate ALARM addendum
at 11:13 for the same incident — three alerts for one transient outage. `deploy-mirror.ps1` /
`lib\deploy-alert.ps1` now self-suppresses repeat "git fetch/pull failed" alerts into one
digest on its own (see that repo's `reference_command_center_mirror_deploy_gap.md`), but this
task runs independently and can't see that state file — so apply the same judgment here:

- Before drafting a per-task alert, check whether the missed/failed task(s) share a single
  root-cause signature: a gap in Windows Task Scheduler history across MULTIPLE unrelated
  tasks in the same window, a LAMS fleet catch-up firing, or a task's own output/log citing
  `git fetch`/`git pull`/"network unreachable"/"could not resolve host". That pattern means
  **the machine was offline**, not that N different automations independently broke.
- If that pattern holds AND the affected task(s) show evidence of self-recovery (a successful
  run after the gap closes), do NOT draft a separate Gabriel alert for each one — note it once
  in the Notion status report as a single "machine offline HH:MM–HH:MM ET, N tasks affected,
  all self-recovered" line, and skip Step 4 for those tasks entirely.
- If a task in that same window did NOT show evidence of recovery once the outage window
  closed, still alert individually for that task — the correlation covers the transient
  blip, not a genuine independent failure that happens to overlap it.
- This correlation NEVER applies to a GATE CHECK FAILED / CRITICAL confidential-exposure
  signature — that alert class stays loud and per-incident regardless of what else is
  happening on the machine.

### Step 4 — Alert Gabriel on any failures

If any task shows ⚠️ or ❌ (and Step 3.5 didn't already fold it into a single offline-window note):

1. Draft a notification email to [ggoldberg@oxfordra.net](mailto:ggoldberg@oxfordra.net) ONLY (no cc — routing canon 2026-06-10; the cc-Eric exception applies solely to the ora-am-brief Daily Brief). Send path when running unattended: Outlook COM via `C:\Users\Owner\.claude\scheduled-tasks\_shared\send-via-outlook.ps1` — the SOLE send path. Include:
   - Subject: "⚠️ Cowork Automation Alert — \[Task Name\] missed \[date\]"
   - Body: task name, scheduled time, what output was expected, what was found instead, suggested remediation steps
2. Present the draft to Gabriel for review before sending (ALWAYS ask before sending emails)

---

## REMEDIATION GUIDANCE (illustrative, NOT authoritative — map to whichever live task actually missed)

**`ora-ar-export-freshness-nudge` / any QB-dependent task missed:** Likely the QB Desktop export (Reports → P&L by Class and Cash Flow Statement) was not completed and uploaded to the SharePoint QB Exports folder for the 1st/15th cycle. QuickBooks Desktop-only per standing tool hierarchy — no MCP auto-export exists; Composio retired 2026-06-11, never suggest re-auth.

**`ora-lease-expiration-brief` missed:** Run manually by saying "Check lease expirations in the next 90 days" (invokes `lease-renewal-pipeline`).

**`ora-om-intake-ocr` / `ora-owner-outreach-queue-refresh` / any Notion-writing task missed:** Check Notion MCP connectivity first (`net::ERR_FAILED`-class outages have occurred before); re-run manually once connectivity is confirmed.

**`ora-dashboard-refresh`** is not a live scheduled task (its `oxford-perfection` project root no longer exists, retired per the 2026-08-05 OI-025 sweep) — if you're troubleshooting Command Center dashboard/mirror freshness instead, that's the native Windows Scheduled Task `deploy-mirror.ps1`, monitored by the live `ora-command-center-mirror-drift-check`; check Cloudflare Pages deploy status for `ora-command-center.pages.dev` and confirm the confidentiality filter (strips "Fulton" references) didn't hard-fail the build.

**Any task missed due to desktop being closed:** Both fleets (CC/MCP and LAMS/Cowork) fire only while the Desktop app is open. If this pattern recurs, flag it to Gabriel — the dead-man chain (`ora-cowork-heartbeat` → Notion → GitHub watchdog) covers extended outages, but routine desktop uptime is the fix.

**General:** for any task not covered above, read its own `SKILL.md`/`SCHEDULED_TASK.md` (path returned by `list_scheduled_tasks`) for task-specific expected output and failure modes rather than guessing from this list.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

- Always post to Notion Operations Hub (use Notion MCP)
- Always present a summary to Gabriel in the Cowork chat
- Keep the chat summary to 5 lines or fewer — Gabriel can see details in Notion

## Changelog

- **v1.8 (2026-08-28):** Added Step 1.25 — one-time tickler lifecycle check. Root incident: `ora-754-flaute-escalation-check` fired ~1h41m late (AM catch-up burst throttle delay) and auto-disabled normally, but a fleet-status/setup-self-audit advisory snapshotted pre-fire read it as "expired, not yet fired, still enabled" and was acted on after it had already completed — a disabled one-time task is indistinguishable from a genuinely stuck one unless `lastRunAt` is checked against `fireAt`. Now explicit: `disabled + lastRunAt set` = normal completion, never flag; `disabled + no lastRunAt` = genuinely anomalous, flag; `enabled + past fireAt, not yet fired` = re-verify live before flagging, don't trust an old snapshot. Companion fix, same incident, different file: `fleet-status.py` now stamps every report with `generated_at` and a staleness warning in both text and JSON output, so the caveat travels with a forwarded/pasted copy instead of depending on the reading skill's own discipline.
- **v1.7 (2026-08-24, Gabriel-directed — "fix all workflow optimizations" from that morning's Automation Health report):** Step 1.75's Windows Task Scheduler leg no longer recites a hardcoded roster; it **enumerates** (`Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'ORA*'`) and diffs the live set against a roster *baseline*. v1.6 shipped naming seven tasks; a live enumeration three days later returned **nine** — `ORA Fleet Pause-Resume Guard` and `ORA Mirror Deploy Classifier` had been invisible to this skill since they were created. This is the same hardcoded-roster failure v1.2 fixed for the fleet tables one layer up, and it bites harder here: a name absent from the list is not merely unreported but *unreportable*, because nothing else on this machine watches these tasks. It is also self-undermining — one of the two missing tasks was part of the very pause machinery that run spent most of its effort reasoning about. The diff is now bidirectional: live-but-unrostered is `OFF-FLEET-UNTRACKED` (ℹ️, and update the baseline in the same pass), rostered-but-absent is `OFF-FLEET-DISAPPEARED` (⚠️ — a deleted watchdog is the one case where silence really does mean something broke). Also fixed a latent defect in the v1.6 command: `Get-ScheduledTaskInfo` does not emit `State`, so the single-pipeline `Select-Object ...,State,...` had been silently returning a blank column — it is now two commands. Roster baseline updated to the live 9. Companion changes the same day, in their own files: `phantom-dispatch-probe.py` gained a frozen-log gate (root cause of that morning's anomaly was **not** the probe — `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs` had stopped being written at 2026-08-20 20:51 and three separate detectors reported success off 4-day-stale bytes), and the scheduled-task `automation-health-monitor` SKILL.md gained Step 0.5d PAUSED-SLOT suppression.
- **v1.6 (2026-08-21, `open-items-tracker.md#OI-197` fix (b)):** Added Step 1.75 — read-only enumeration of two off-fleet substrates this skill previously couldn't see: 7 native Windows Task Scheduler ORA tasks, and the 2 GitHub Actions cron workflows in `ZeOoba/ora-cowork-watchdog`. Root incident: during the 2026-08-17 fleet pause, `ORA Command Center - Mirror Deploy` (a Windows Task Scheduler task, off-fleet by design) failed silently for a day because its own classifier, `ora-command-center-mirror-drift-check`, is itself an on-fleet CC task and went dark with the rest of the pause — the design was correct, only its consumer was offline. Includes explicit `LastTaskResult` decode guidance (0xC000013A terminated, 0x8007042B benign stop-condition, 0x00041301 SCHED_S_TASK_RUNNING is NOT a failure, and per-script exit-code-1 conventions) so this doesn't start crying wolf on a still-running or intentionally-nonzero task. Report-only — no new scheduled task, no new alert cadence, per this skill's existing routing; a real gap found here still needs Gabriel's confirmation before anything gets registered.
- **v1.5 (2026-08-15):** New finding (ora-skill-text-audit 2026-08-15 coverage-gap-1 investigation). `ora-dashboard-refresh` had genuinely gone stale in two places, unlike its 10 sibling names in the "does not match a live task" disclaimer list, which were already accurate: (1) the disclaimer list itself didn't include it, even though it's been unregisterable since its `oxford-perfection` project root was deleted (confirmed via the 2026-08-05 OI-025 sweep README) — added, with a note on its live successor (`deploy-mirror.ps1` / `ora-command-center-mirror-drift-check`, an architectural supersession, not a rename); (2) the REMEDIATION GUIDANCE entry told an operator to check Cloudflare Pages for this specific dead task name — reworded to point at the actual live mirror-deploy mechanism instead. Two flagged-but-confirmed-different candidates from the same investigation (`ora-sofr-direct-prefetch` vs. `ora-treasury-yield-prefetch`; `ora-cc-snapshot-refresh` vs. `ora-dashboard-refresh` itself) needed no fix — this skill's existing text about them was already correct. No health-check logic, alerting threshold, or Notion/email routing changed.
- **v1.4 (2026-07-12):** ADDED Step 1.5 model-currency check (both fleets). The methodology was documented in `reference_scheduled_task_model_standard.md` as an existing "Step 0.07" but had never actually been written into this SKILL.md body — this closes that doc-vs-skill gap. LAMS = match-standard; CC/MCP = presence+observation-freshness (model is server-pinned, not settable; the earlier "structurally uncoverable" claim was corrected — CC/MCP `[MODEL: ...]` frontmatter tags ARE readable, e.g. `ora-cc-schematic-refresh`). Informational-only (Notion report, never a Gabriel alert).
- **v1.3 (2026-07-10):** added Step 3.5 machine-offline correlation — collapse per-task alerts into one Notion note when a Task Scheduler gap / LAMS catch-up / git-fetch-unreachable signature spans multiple self-recovered tasks in the same window, instead of one Gabriel email per task; never applies to GATE CHECK FAILED/CRITICAL. Companion to `deploy-mirror.ps1`/`lib/deploy-alert.ps1` offline-signature suppression in oxford-command-center.
- **v1.2 (2026-07-08):** the v1.1 hardcoded legacy 9(+)-task table and task-named Remediation Guidance were never actually removed despite the v1.1 changelog claiming it — now genuinely replaced with an explicitly-illustrative, dated live-pull snapshot plus generic/current-task remediation; `ora-lease-expiration-brief` schedule slip corrected 8:20→8:30 AM.

Moved out of the frontmatter `description` field (2026-07-12) — that field had drifted to 1,379 chars, exceeding the platform's 1,024-char limit and blocking `package_skills.py`. No content removed, only relocated; frontmatter now carries a short version tag only, matching `register-scheduled-task`'s convention. No v1.0/v1.1 changelog text existed in the source description to carry forward.
