# Replacement Cost Table (RCT v03) Provenance and Submarket Intelligence Sourcing

Extracted verbatim from `acquisition-underwriting/SKILL.md` (2026-08-13, progressive-disclosure split) — content below is UNCHANGED from the original, only relocated. The main SKILL.md keeps the RCT v03 market table ($/SF figures Stage 1's Basis floor actually divides by), the adder schedule, the retired-benchmarks guardrail, and the operative DENOMINATOR-SENSITIVE/pre-FULL-validation rule inline — those are load-bearing on every screen. This file holds the derivation methodology, the "why RCT v02 was replaced" history, the per-market proxy/sourcing narrative, and the Submarket Intelligence table's provenance/caveat text — useful for auditing a figure, not needed to apply it.

## RCT v03 build formula (full text)

**Build formula (each step auditable):**
`POINT = C&W hard cost (small tier) × shallow-bay size premium × soft/profit/financing × escalation`
1. **C&W hard cost, small tier (109,200 rsf)** — SOURCED, per metro, from the guide's Local Market Data tables.
2. **Shallow-bay size premium** — SOURCED, derived from the guide's OWN size curve. Cost scales as `size^−b`; b is fitted per metro from that market's small/medium tiers (0.349–0.364 — remarkably consistent). Scaled from C&W's 109,200 rsf box down to a **40,000 SF** ORA-sized building ⇒ **≈ +43%**.
3. **Soft + developer profit + financing — ×1.30 `[EST]`.** ⚠️ **THE ONE UNSOURCED INPUT.** Industry range is ~1.30–1.45; the **LOW end is chosen deliberately** — a lower multiplier means a lower replacement cost, a *harder* floor, and no risk of overpaying. Replace with a GC/lender quote (see below).
4. **Escalation ×1.0487** — SOURCED: Turner Building Cost Index +4.87% YoY (Q1 2026), the **lowest** of the three available indices (Mortenson +6.77%, AGC input PPI +8.4%). Conservative again. C&W data is March 2025.
5. **Band ±10%** ⇒ LOW = 0.90 × POINT.

## Why RCT v02 was replaced (full text)

**WHY RCT v02 WAS REPLACED — it failed an arithmetic coherence test.** RCT v02 claimed to be *all-in* (hard + soft + profit + financing) yet, for **five of nine markets**, its all-in POINT sat **BELOW** C&W's pure **hard cost** for the same metro: Cincinnati $134.00 < $143.15 · Indianapolis $130.50 < $143.46 · Grand Rapids $120.00 < $143.64 · Richmond $131.50 < $133.70 · Des Moines $130.00 < $131.46. **All-in cannot be less than hard cost — it contains hard cost.** Every market also sat at ~1.0–1.2× C&W when a shallow-bay all-in figure should be ~1.9×. RCT v02 read as if scaled off a **big-box** baseline with the shallow-bay premium never applied. Effect: replacement understated ⇒ computed discounts too small ⇒ **ORA was too STRICT and passing on deals that clear doctrine.** The exception ran the other way — RCT v02 priced **Maryland as the firm's most expensive market ($165)** while C&W's primary data shows Baltimore is **mid-priced ($133.70)**, cheaper to build than Cincinnati; the MD floor was therefore **too generous** and MD deals were being cleared that should not have been.

## Proxy-market narrative (full text; operative DENOMINATOR-SENSITIVE + pre-FULL rule is restated in the main SKILL.md — this is the sourcing narrative behind it)

*PROXY markets (not in the C&W guide): Madison ← Milwaukee · Grand Rapids ← Detroit · Richmond ← Baltimore · Des Moines ← Minneapolis. **Louisville is NOT a proxy — it is SOURCED** (see below). **Grand Rapids is the weakest** — Detroit is a high-cost union market while RSMeans shows Grand Rapids below the national average, so its figure is likely too HIGH (floor too generous). Grand Rapids, Madison, Richmond and Des Moines **always trigger the DENOMINATOR-SENSITIVE flag** — a local insurance comp or GC quote is REQUIRED pre-LOI regardless of proximity to floor. Indianapolis retains its standing flag. **Pre-FULL requirement:** for ANY market carrying a [PROXY] or the [EST] soft-cost multiplier — i.e. all of them, until a quote lands — a local replacement validation MUST be ATTEMPTED before FULL mode, not merely flagged. Document who was contacted, when, and by what method.*

## Louisville sourcing correction (full text)

***LOUISVILLE — SOURCED, NOT PROXIED. Corrected 2026-08-11, same day it was added.*** *Louisville was briefly entered as `[PROXY: Columbus]` on the belief that it was absent from the C&W guide — a belief `target-markets.json` v1.8 also asserts in writing ("Louisville is NOT in the C&W guide and has no independent hard-cost pull"). **That assertion is FALSE.** Louisville is present in the C&W 2025 guide and its figure has been sitting inside ORA's own repo the whole time, at `scheduled-tasks/ora-deal-sourcing-scan/skills/cw-2025-construction-costs.json` — a 45-market extract of the guide's Local Market Data. Louisville small-tier 2025 = **$135.28/SF**, which is the figure now in the table. No proxy is needed or appropriate. **Two lessons worth keeping:** (1) the C&W extract in that task folder is the fastest route to any per-market hard cost — check it BEFORE reaching for a proxy or trying to scrape the flipbook, which is canvas-rendered with no text layer; (2) `target-markets.json`'s Louisville `replacement_cost` block (hard $143.46, "PROXY — Indianapolis") was **wrong on both the number and its stated reason** and was DELETED 2026-08-12 on Gabriel's instruction — Louisville is now the only cluster with no such block. The other nine clusters KEEP theirs by decision (Gabriel, 2026-08-12): those figures are correct and match the C&W hard costs behind RCT v03, and they carry provenance found nowhere else (2024 comparatives, YoY %, land $/acre). They are PROVENANCE, NEVER a denominator — that file's operative benchmark was RETIRED 2026-07-14. Derivation, reproducing the table's own method exactly: b = ln(135.28/80.20) ÷ ln(476,400/109,200) = **0.35492** (inside the 0.349–0.364 band); size premium (109,200/40,000)^b = 1.42824; POINT = $135.28 × 1.42824 × 1.30 × 1.0487 = **$263.41**; LOW = **$237.07**; clears at **$82.97/SF** (≤1995) and **$94.83/SF** (≥2005). This method was refute-tested against all eight source metros behind the other nine rows (Columbus, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Baltimore, Detroit, Minneapolis) and reproduced every ratified POINT and LOW to the cent. Louisville at $135.28 sits below the $139 national small-tier average, corroborating C&W's own "most cost-effective metros" listing, and below both Cincinnati ($143.15) and Indianapolis ($143.46) — so a nearest-neighbour proxy off either would indeed have overstated replacement and loosened the floor. The retired Columbus proxy erred the other way, understating it: it cleared at $80.38/SF against the true $82.97/SF, roughly $104K of purchase price on a 40,000 SF building.*

## GC/lender quote request + independent cross-check (full text)

**THE ONE EMAIL THAT RETIRES EVERY REMAINING [EST]:** ask a GC (or a lender's cost consultant) in each core market for a current **all-in $/SF to build a 30–50K SF Class B/C shallow-bay shell**. One reply settles the soft/profit/financing multiplier, the shallow-bay premium, and the PEMB-vs-tilt-up delta simultaneously — the three open estimates in this table.

**Independent cross-check (2026-07-25):** WareSpace, "The State of Micro-Bay Industrial Real Estate 2026" (published 2026-01-02, updated 2026-06-21; warespace.com/resources/reports/the-state-of-micro-bay-industrial-real-estate-2026) cites $160–220/SF for new small-bay industrial construction nationally — a blended figure across markets and product tiers, below RCT v03's ORA-specific spec. RCT v03's own POINT figures ($253–282/SF, all-in Class B/C shallow-bay, 40,000 SF ORA-sized product, escalated to 2026) sit meaningfully above that range — consistent with RCT v03 correcting RCT v02's understated denominator (see "WHY RCT v02 WAS REPLACED" above), not evidence RCT v03 overshoots. Directional corroboration only, per the vendor-report sourcing rule (Stage 2.1) — WareSpace is an operator with a promotional interest in the small-bay category, and its figure is not a market/product match for RCT v03's own build. Cite in IC memo footnotes as: "independent third-party estimate corroborates RCT v03's escalation direction (WareSpace 2026)" — never as a standalone replacement-cost source or as a substitute for the GC/lender quote above.

## Submarket Intelligence Reference — sourcing/provenance narrative (full text)

**Full report:** `oxford-command-center/outputs/2026-06-22_Submarket_Intelligence_Report_v01.docx` · **Memory (corrected 2026-07-11):** the table below is the live source for this data — no per-metro `market-intel-*` file was ever created for any of the 8 metros here, and memory-policy.md v2's fixed doc set (rewritten 2026-06-03, anti-sprawl) carves out no exception for one. Independently ORA-validated cross-market stats (vacancy/rent/cap rate, source + date cited) live in `markets.md` instead — cross-check both. **Re-research cadence:** annually or when metro grade changes ±1 tier. **Sourcing discipline (v4.3):** any future refresh of this table MUST cite primary/institutional-grade series (CBRE, Cushman & Wakefield MarketBeat, NCREIF/NAIOP where applicable) and tag each cell's source tier — a 2026-07-18 research pass confirmed the general "shallow-bay is supply-constrained" thesis is genuinely well-sourced at the primary level, but also confirmed at least one widely-repeated brokerage-blog statistic (an unattributed "small buildings are X% of stock but under 2% of the construction pipeline" figure) traces to a single unsourced marketing post with no independent citation anywhere. That specific figure is not cited anywhere in this skill and should not be added on a future refresh without independent primary-source verification — repetition across blogs is not corroboration.

## RCT v03 — paving/lighting-intensity adder detail (v4.6, full text)

**Paving/lighting-intensity adder detail (v4.6):** covers dealership-grade or retail-frontage-grade reinforced concrete/asphalt display paving plus elevated pole-lighting density — a surface-finish and lighting-spec adder, distinct from "excess site work" above (which covers civil/utility SCOPE — deep utilities, detention, heavy yard grading — not surface paving/lighting spec). **Do not stack both site-work adders for the same paving scope:** if a parcel's heavy paving IS its excess site work, apply one adder, not both, and document which. `[EST]` pending a GC/lender quote per "THE ONE EMAIL" below — until then this is a judgment-anchored placeholder like the soft/profit/financing multiplier, not a sourced figure. Formalizes what was an ad-hoc judgment call (Pike Plaza automotive-dealership parcels, 2026-07-27 underwrite) into a standing, documented adder.

## RCT v03 — vintage-ramp note and stale downstream consumers (full text)

**Vintage-ramp note:** the linear floor ramp in Stage 1 (**65% discount floor at ≤1995 → 60% at ≥2005**, recalibrated 2026-07-14 alongside RCT v03) is the authoritative hand-screen formula. ⚠️ **DOWNSTREAM CONSUMERS ARE NOW STALE AND MUST BE UPDATED BEFORE USE:** the `parcel-data-recovery` skill still uses the old simplified 25%/30% cliff against RCT v02 constants, and the platform engine (`config/replacement-cost.v1.json`) still carries a flat $125/$137.50/$150. **Both are now WRONG on both the denominator and the floor.** Any screen run through them since 2026-07-14 must be re-derived. On any conflict, the Stage 1 linear ramp + RCT v03 governs IC memos and screens.

## RCT v03 — reconciliation: RETIRED BENCHMARKS (do not use, do not re-introduce; full text)

**Reconciliation — RETIRED BENCHMARKS (do not use, do not re-introduce):**
- `target-markets.json` briefly carried a **C&W-hard-cost operative benchmark** (Columbus $130.51 etc., flat 25% floor), ratified the morning of 2026-07-14 and **retired the same day**. It was a *hard-cost, big-box, March-2025* figure standing in for an *all-in, shallow-bay, 2026* one — a worse instrument than RCT, and a second competing denominator. C&W's proper role is as the **primary source feeding RCT v03**, and as the **coherence check** that caught RCT v02's error. It is not itself a benchmark.
- The pre-2026-07-14 sourcing-scan constants ($140 Midwest / $170 MD / $150 Richmond / $130 DSM) were never sourced at all. Retired.
- **There is now ONE denominator: RCT v03. If you find a second, it is a bug.**
