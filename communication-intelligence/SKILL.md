description: "Context-enriched communication drafting for Oxford Realty Advisors. Use this skill whenever the user mentions: write an email, draft a response, compose a message, reply to, reach out to, follow up with, send a letter to, communicate with, notify, or any request to produce a written communication to a tenant, broker, vendor, lender, attorney, or counterparty. Also trigger when the user receives an email and needs help crafting a response. This skill automatically enriches drafts with relationship context from Notion, HubSpot, and conversation history. v1.1 (2026-07-08: standard signature block corrected — was signing outbound comms as 'Ze Ooba' / ze@oxfordra.net, a stale/incorrect identity; now Gabriel Goldberg / ggoldberg@oxfordra.net per routing canon)"

# Communication Intelligence — Oxford Realty Advisors

## MODULE 1: CONTEXT ENRICHMENT WORKFLOW

Before drafting any communication, execute this enrichment sequence:

### Step 1 — Identify the Recipient
Determine recipient type:
- **Tenant** → known occupant of an Oxford property
- **Broker** → industrial or commercial real estate broker
- **Vendor / Service Provider** → maintenance, legal, environmental, accounting, insurance
- **Lender** → bank, life insurance company, or private lender
- **Attorney** → transaction counsel, tenant counsel, opposing counsel
- **Government / Regulatory** → tax assessor, zoning authority, environmental agency
- **Partner / Internal** → Eric, Gabriel, co-investors

### Step 2 — Pull Relationship Context by Recipient Type

**TENANT:**
Search Notion Tenant Database for:
- Property address and unit/suite
- Current base rent and rent PSF
- Lease commencement and expiration dates
- Escalation schedule and next escalation date
- Current AR balance and collections status
- Payment history (on-time, chronic late, delinquent)
- Renewal status and any renewal offer outstanding
- Security deposit amount on file
- Personal guaranty status
- Insurance expiration and compliance status
- Tenant Grade (A/B/C/D)
- Any open maintenance requests or disputes

**BROKER:**
Search HubSpot contacts for:
- Deals this broker has submitted (property, size, price, outcome)
- Current deal stage for any active submission
- Last interaction date
- Markets the broker covers
- Relationship quality (preferred vs. occasional vs. new)

**VENDOR:**
Search Notion Vendor & Advisor Directory for:
- Service type and scope
- Current contract status and expiration
- Performance history
- Billing relationship (hourly, retainer, per-project)

**LENDER:**
Search memory and conversation history for:
- Loan details (property, balance, rate, maturity)
- Relationship status (active borrower, applicant, prospective)
- Past interactions and covenant compliance status

**ATTORNEY:**
Search Notion Key Contacts for:
- Role and specialty (transaction, litigation, environmental, tax)
- Active matters
- Billing relationship and hourly rate
- Firm conflicts to be aware of

### Step 3 — Check for Active Issues
Before drafting, verify:
- Any open AR balance or active collections stage (flag collections letters to use escalating tone)
- Any pending lease expiration within 180 days (flag renewal context)
- Any active deal involving this contact (flag deal-specific sensitivity)
- Any recent correspondence in Email Response Queue (avoid duplicating prior communication)
- Any legal hold or dispute in progress (flag for precise, protective language)

### Step 4 — Determine Communication Posture
Select the appropriate posture based on context:
- **Routine / informational** → professional, neutral, efficient
- **Collections (Stage 1 — Reminder)** → courteous but direct; reference lease obligation
- **Collections (Stage 2 — Formal Notice)** → firm; cite lease section; state cure deadline
- **Collections (Stage 3 — Demand)** → no pleasantries; formal demand; state escalation consequence
- **Collections (Stage 4 — Legal Referral)** → notify referral to legal counsel; cease direct negotiations
- **Renewal negotiation** → firm but constructive; emphasize mutual benefit and continuity value
- **New relationship / outreach** → warm, highlight Oxford's track record and capabilities
- **Legal / adversarial** → precise, formal, protective of Oxford's rights; no admissions

## MODULE 2: TONE AND STYLE GUIDELINES

Oxford communications must be:
- **Direct and professional** — no unnecessary preamble, pleasantries, or filler phrases
- **Specific** — always reference property address, unit/suite number, lease dates, dollar amounts, and section citations
- **Actionable** — every communication ends with a clear ask, deadline, or next step
- **Entity-aware** — always use the correct Oxford LLC entity as the signatory (not "Oxford Realty Advisors" generically when a specific LLC is landlord)
- **Measured** — never emotional, never threatening language that could be used against Oxford in litigation

### Signature Block (standard)
```
Gabriel Goldberg
Oxford Realty Advisors
[Direct Phone]
ggoldberg@oxfordra.net
oxfordra.net
```

### Entity Awareness
When drafting landlord communications, use the correct entity:
- Verify which LLC holds the subject property from memory context or Notion Entity Structure DB
- Sign as: "[Property LLC Name], by Oxford Realty Advisors, its Manager"
- Do not sign as "Oxford Realty Advisors" if the actual landlord is a separate property LLC

- Signature: first name only or abbreviated block

### HubSpot Note (internal CRM entry)
- Third-person narrative: "Gabriel spoke with [Broker Name] re: [Deal]..."
- No salutation or closing

## MODULE 5: TEMPLATE INTEGRATION

When communication type matches a document-assembly template, use that template as the base and layer relationship context on top. Reference the `document-assembly` skill for:
- Renewal offer letters (tenant-specific rent schedule populated)
- Collections notices (lease section citations auto-populated)
- LOI and PSA cover letters (deal-specific terms populated)
- Lender correspondence (loan terms populated from Loan Portfolio Tracker)

---

## TRIGGER PHRASES
Activate this skill when Gabriel says:
"write an email", "draft a response", "compose a letter", "reply to", "reach out to", "follow up with", "send a letter", "communicate with", "notify", "collections letter", "renewal offer", "broker outreach", "COI request", "demand letter", "tenant notice", "lender update", "vendor communication", "how should I respond to", "what should I say to"

## Changelog

- v1.1 (2026-07-08): CRITICAL fix (Skill Text Audit finding 1) — Standard Signature Block (§ Module 2) signed outbound comms as "Ze Ooba" / `ze@oxfordra.net`, an incorrect/retired identity never valid for this principal. Corrected to Gabriel Goldberg / `ggoldberg@oxfordra.net` per current routing canon. Entity Awareness logic immediately below (landlord mail signs as the property LLC, not the generic firm name) was reviewed and left intact — not regressed by this fix. Note: this repo copy already carried the correct block; the installed Cowork runtime copy did not (silent re-sync drift) — repackage and reinstall via `package-and-stage-skill` to close the gap.
