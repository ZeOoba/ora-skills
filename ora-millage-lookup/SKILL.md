# ORA Millage & Assessment Lookup

Purpose: turn `[EST]` property-tax figures into sourced, reproducible ones. Under Buy Box v1.1 an unknown reassessed tax caps a deal at **T2 WATCH**, and `acquisition-underwriting` STAGE 2.5 item 5 makes a rate-pull attempt a **pre-FULL requirement** — this skill is that attempt, executed the same way every time.

Sibling to `ora-flood-zoning-dd`: same shape (a ladder over verified government endpoints, a registry in `references/endpoints.md`, an explicit UNVERIFIED verdict when every tier fails). Built 2026-08-03 once a second state/district static endpoint was confirmed, the threshold `acquisition-underwriting` v4.6 set for systematizing this.

## Decision rules

- A resolved figure carries **four** things or it is not resolved: the **rate**, its **unit**, the **taxable base** it applies to, and a **source + retrieval date**. A bare percentage is not an answer.
- **Never assert a rate without a named source and date.** If every tier fails, report **UNVERIFIED** explicitly and fall back to the State Reassessment Matrix range midpoint as `[EST]` — logging the specific attempts (tier, endpoint, date, what came back) per the pre-FULL requirement. A bare `[EST] — verify pre-LOI` with no attempt logged is INCOMPLETE for FULL mode.
- **The taxable base is not the headline assessment.** Phase-ins (DC, MD), caps (IN 3% GAV, IA 90% rollback), and abatements/PILOTs all drive a wedge between the assessment a portal displays and the value tax is actually computed on. Compute the pro-forma on the **post-sale reassessed** basis per the State Reassessment Matrix — never on the seller's in-place bill, and never on a displayed assessment you haven't reconciled to the bill.
- **A pulled rate describes the seller's year, not yours.** Rates move annually; a sale resets the base in most footprint states. The pull establishes the rate and the current base — the reassessment calculation still runs.
- **On tiers 2–3, get the MECHANISM, not the answer (added v1.1, 2026-08-24).** Tier 2 and tier 3 put you in front of a human at an assessor's or auditor's office, and the answers that come back are reassuringly conclusive — "your taxes won't change," "you'll be reassessed at sale," "there's no reassessment on a transfer here." **None of those is a filing path.** Push one level down every time and record it: **what instrument resets the base** (a transfer/conveyance form, a sales-disclosure filing, a new-owner declaration), **who files it and when**, **what triggers the recompute** (the sale itself, the next lien date, the next reappraisal cycle), and **when the new figure is certified**. A verbal "it won't change" that is really "it won't change until the January 1 lien date" is a different pro-forma from the same words meaning "this state doesn't reset on sale" — and the two are indistinguishable in a note that records only the answer. Where the mechanism can't be pinned down, that is an UNVERIFIED tier, not a resolved one. Same discipline as `ora-flood-zoning-dd` Step 6A applies to entitlements; see `acquisition-underwriting` STAGE 2.5 item 5.
- This skill **reads**. It never writes a determination into a master workbook in place — same rule as `ora-flood-zoning-dd` (copy to a new `YYYYMMDD_[Name]_v##.xlsx` first).

## The ladder (run in order; record which tier resolved it)

1. **State/county published static certified-rate document.** A state DOR/DLGF-style annual "Certified Tax Rates by District/County" PDF at a stable government URL. **PREFERRED whenever it exists** — fetchable, citable, search-indexable, no session required.
2. **Direct county assessor/auditor parcel record** — a REST/JSON service where one exists (see registry), otherwise the county's parcel-search page or a phone/portal query. A government REST service that answers a scripted query with no interactive session is **tier-1-equivalent**; treat it as tier 1 for citation purposes and say so.
3. **Interactive state/county GIS or tax portal** (e.g. Indiana's DLGF Gateway) — **LAST resort**. Not indexable by search, needs a live session; if reached only this way, log the query date and the screen values used.
4. **State Reassessment Matrix range midpoint**, `[EST]`, only after 1–3 are genuinely unattainable, with the attempts logged.

**Why the order:** tier 3 is exactly what a bare WebSearch reliably fails to reach, and tier 1 frequently succeeds where tier 3 doesn't — a static government PDF is a document, an interactive query tool is an application.

## Pitfalls — every one of these has produced a wrong or missing answer

1. **HTTP 200 with zero results is not "no data."** ArcGIS `/query` returns a full 200 response — field definitions, aliases, the lot — with an **empty `features` array** when the `where` clause matches nothing. A malformed key looks exactly like a parcel that doesn't exist. **Always check `len(features)`, never the status code or the response size.** (Confirmed 2026-08-03: a 26 KB, HTTP-200 DC response containing zero features.) This is the verified-null-vs-inferred-null rule in its most common concrete form.
2. **Parcel keys are often fixed-width composites.** DC's SSL is 4-char square + padding + 4-char lot — `SSL='0199    0821'` with **four** spaces resolves; one or two spaces returns the 200/zero-features above. When padding is uncertain, use a `LIKE` query (`SSL LIKE '0199%0821'`) and confirm you got exactly one feature.
3. **Do not "correct" a government URL.** Indiana's published filename is `2026_Certifed_Tax_Rates_By_District.pdf` — the typo (`Certifed`) is **in the state's own filename**. Verified 2026-08-03: the typo'd URL returns 200 (649,963 bytes); the correctly-spelled variant returns 404. Fetch the literal string in the registry.
4. **Units differ by state and are silently interchangeable-looking.** DC's `TAXRATE` field returns `1.65` meaning **$1.65 per $100** (= 1.65%); Indiana publishes a certified rate as a **percent of AV** (2.6830%); Michigan quotes **mills** (44.75 mills = 4.475%). Record the unit alongside the number, and sanity-check by reproducing the actual bill.
5. **Reconcile the rate against a real bill before trusting it.** `ANNUALTAX ÷ TAXRATE` recovers the taxable base; if that base is nowhere near any assessment field on the record, one of the three is wrong or a phase-in/abatement is in play. Do this check every time — it is one division and it catches unit errors, wrong-parcel pulls, and phase-in surprises at once.
6. **One parcel ≠ one deal.** Multi-parcel assemblages (and condo/underlying-lot structures) carry separate rates and bases. Pull each; never extrapolate one parcel's rate across a portfolio.

## Output block (paste into the facts file / IC memo §6 source note)

```
PARCEL      <address> — <county/district>, <state>  ·  key: <APN/SSL/parcel id>
RATE        <value> <unit>  (e.g. 1.65 per $100 = 1.65%)
TAXABLE     <base> — <how derived: field name, or ANNUALTAX ÷ RATE>
ASSESSMENT  current <x> / proposed <y>   [if the record carries both]
IN-PLACE    <seller's annual tax>  ·  history: <years available>
PRO-FORMA   <post-sale reassessed tax>  ·  <$/SF>   [per State Reassessment Matrix]
TIER        <1|2|3|4> — <endpoint or document>
SOURCE      <URL or office/method> · retrieved <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

Anything unresolved: state it as **UNVERIFIED** with the attempts logged, never as a silent `[EST]`.

## Registry

`references/endpoints.md` — per-state/district verified endpoints, status flags (V = live-verified with a date, U = unverified pattern / not yet discovered), and per-jurisdiction caveats. **Two entries are V today (Indiana DLGF, DC OTR/DCGIS); everything else is U.** That is a coverage statement, not a gap to paper over — an absent entry means run tier 2/3 by hand for that county and add what you find.

Cross-links: `county-parcel-screen`'s `references/county-endpoints.v1.json` (parcel/CAMA geometry layers, 22 counties) often carries the same service root as the assessor's tax record — check it before discovering an endpoint from scratch. `ora-flood-zoning-dd` Step 1 uses that same registry.

## Changelog

- v1.1 (2026-08-24): Added the **get-the-mechanism-not-the-answer** decision rule for tiers 2–3, where the source is a person at an assessor's or auditor's office rather than a document. The ladder was built to guarantee a *sourced* figure and says nothing about the difference between a favorable verbal answer and a reset mechanism — "your taxes won't change" is a sentence, not a filing path, and it can mean "not until the January 1 lien date" or "this state doesn't reset on sale," which are different pro-formas. The rule now requires the instrument that resets the base, who files it and when, what triggers the recompute, and when the figure is certified; a mechanism that can't be pinned down makes the tier UNVERIFIED, not resolved. Origin is the entitlement analogue at 754 Old State Route 74, where a written "no special approval needed" from a township turned out to sit on top of a minor-amendment application — encoded as `ora-flood-zoning-dd` Step 6A the same day. No ladder order, endpoint, or output field changed.
- v1.0 (2026-08-03): initial. Built out of `acquisition-underwriting` v4.7, which recorded the DC OTR/DCGIS endpoint as the second confirmed state/district static endpoint and thereby met the two-endpoint systematization threshold v4.6 had set. Ladder text is the canonical copy of Stage 2.5 item 5's; pitfalls 1–3 and 5 come from the 1518 K St NW underwrite and its 2026-08-03 merge-time re-verification.
