## MODULE 5: ANNUAL VALUATION METHODOLOGY

For portfolio valuation updates:

**Income Approach (primary method):**
- Stabilized NOI = In-place NOI adjusted for known lease changes in next 12 months
- Market cap rate by submarket (pull from memory or web search):
  - Columbus OH shallow-bay: [search for current market cap rate]
  - MD/DC industrial: [search for current market cap rate]
  - Kansas City MO: [search for current market cap rate]
  - Indianapolis IN: [search for current market cap rate]
- Property value = Stabilized NOI ÷ Market cap rate
- Portfolio value = Sum of all property values

**Replacement Cost Check (secondary validation):**
- Estimated replacement cost per SF by market: $85–$120/SF depending on market
- If income approach value < replacement cost, flag as below-replacement-cost confirmation

**Discount to Replacement Cost:**
- Calculate: (Replacement cost per SF − Income approach value per SF) ÷ Replacement cost per SF
- Report as "acquisition premium/discount to replacement cost" for each property
