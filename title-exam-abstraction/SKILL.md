name: title-exam-abstraction
description: 'Abstract a title exam, title commitment, preliminary report, or recorded-instrument set for Oxford Realty Advisors and turn every encumbrance into a tracked deal-terms-register item. Use when the user mentions: title exam, title commitment, title report, prelim, Schedule B, Schedule B-II exceptions, title exceptions, encumbrance review, cross-collateral, cross-default, assignment of rents, mortgage payoff, easement of record, deed restriction, chain of title, vesting, legal description, mortgage location survey, ALTA survey, or uploads a title exam / commitment / recorded instrument. Also trigger when a deal folder contains title work older than 90 days. Distinguishes what a document ESTABLISHES from what it merely reports, separates boundary surveys from mortgage location surveys, and routes every finding to a closing deliverable, a survey order, or a register item. Never substitutes for counsel. v1.0'

# Title Exam Abstraction — Oxford Realty Advisors

Turns title work into a decision. Three outputs, every time: **what is established**, **what must be
cleared before closing**, and **what remains unknown and who is ordering it**.

This skill abstracts and routes. It does not opine on marketability or insurability — that is counsel's
call, and every output says so.

---

## OPERATING PRINCIPLES

1. **A title exam reports; a commitment insures.** An examiner's abstract is one professional's read of
   the record. Only a commitment binds an underwriter. Never let an exam stand in for a commitment in a
   closing decision, and always say which one is in hand.
2. **Age is a defect.** Title work older than 90 days is stale; older than a year it is a lead, not a
   finding. State the age in the first line of every output.
3. **OCR-derived recording references are directional.** Title exams are frequently handwritten on a form.
   Book/page numbers, dollar figures and dates read by OCR must be re-pulled from the current commitment
   before they enter any deal document. Say so explicitly rather than presenting them as verified.
4. **Every exception routes somewhere.** No exception is ever abstracted and left. Each one exits this
   skill as a closing deliverable, a survey order, a register item, an accepted title exception, or a
   question for counsel — named, with an owner.
5. **Read the instrument, not the summary line.** A one-line "cross-easement agreement" entry can be a
   multi-party instrument that the seller cannot terminate alone. Pull and read anything that constrains
   use, access, parking or transfer.

## STEP 1 — CLASSIFY THE DOCUMENT SET

Before abstracting, name what is actually in hand. These are not interchangeable:

| Document | What it establishes | What it does NOT |
|---|---|---|
| Title exam / abstract | One examiner's read of the record chain | Does not insure; no underwriter is bound |
| Title commitment (Sch. A + B) | The underwriter's terms to insure, and its required cures | Not a survey; Schedule B-II survives closing unless cured |
| Owner's policy (prior) | What a prior owner was insured for, as of its date | Says nothing about the intervening period |
| Recorded instrument | The actual bargain — controls over any summary of it | May be superseded by a later instrument |
| **ALTA/NSPS survey** | Boundary, improvements, encroachments, plotted easements | — |
| **Mortgage location survey** | **Almost nothing for a buyer** — see below | Not a boundary survey; no title research |

**The mortgage-location-survey trap (Ohio: OAC 4733-38 vs 4733-37).** A mortgage location survey is
prepared for a lender's closing, states on its face that no title or abstract research was performed, and
that boundary and easement information came from client-furnished deed material and "may or may not be
complete." It cannot support a PSA legal description, a square-footage reconciliation, an easement
exhibit, or any site-plan decision. When one is the only survey in a deal folder, the correct output is
an **ALTA/NSPS survey order**, and the memo should say plainly that the file currently has no survey for
buyer purposes. Check the certification block and the governing administrative-code citation — the
distinction is stated there, not in the title.

Also record, for each document: preparer, date, client (a survey prepared for a lender names that lender —
useful evidence of the encumbrance history), and the parcel/auditor number.

---

## STEP 2 — SCANNED-DOCUMENT DISCIPLINE

Title exams are commonly handwritten on a printed form and scanned. Where the document has no text layer:

1. Render page images (`pdftoppm -r 300 -png`) and build a contact sheet before reading OCR output.
2. Read the exam form's ruled sections visually — Vesting, Mortgages, Easements, Restrictions, Taxes,
   Assessments, Liens/Judgments. Handwriting in these sections is the finding.
3. Recorded instruments attached behind the form usually OCR well; the form itself usually does not.
4. Mark every figure and recording reference taken from OCR as `[OCR — verify]`.

This mirrors `lease-abstraction-pipeline` STEP 2A. Same failure mode, same discipline.

---

## STEP 3 — ABSTRACT (field set)

**A. Vesting and chain**
Record owner exactly as titled, including entity type and state of formation · vesting deed (instrument,
date) · whether the vested name matches the PSA seller **exactly** — a DBA, a predecessor partnership, or
a similar-but-different entity is a finding, not a formality · any gap or unrecorded conveyance in the chain.

**B. Monetary encumbrances**
For each: instrument type (mortgage, deed of trust, assignment of rents, UCC, judgment, mechanic's lien) ·
lender/holder · recording reference · original face amount · date · whether an assignment of rents or
leases accompanies it.

**C. Cross-collateral and cross-default — treat as its own category**
Where the parcel secures obligations beyond its own note, this is the single finding most able to move a
closing date, and it is routinely buried in a "liens" line. Capture: every cross-collateral, cross-default
and blanket-lien instrument · which other properties or obligations are implicated · and, critically, that
**payoff of the note is not the same as release of the parcel from the package.** Both are separate
closing deliverables and both need written confirmation from the lender.

**D. Easements and use restrictions**
Grantee, purpose, width, recording reference, and whether it is plottable · separate *utility* easements
(usually accepted) from *access, parking, cross-easement and reciprocal* instruments (usually operative
constraints on the business plan) · for any multi-party instrument, identify **every party and every
successor**, because the seller alone cannot terminate or amend it · covenants, PD/PUD conditions, and
whether any recorded instrument is a zoning requirement (ask the municipality in writing; do not infer).

**E. Taxes and assessments**
Current installments, paid/unpaid status, special assessments, CAUV or abatement status, and any pending
reassessment. Cross-reference the pro-forma reassessed figure from `acquisition-underwriting`.

**F. Legal description**
Reproduce it. Flag any conflict with the PSA exhibit, the auditor record, or the survey — and note that
only an ALTA survey resolves an acreage or SF conflict.

---

## STEP 4 — ROUTE EVERY FINDING

Each abstracted item exits as exactly one of:

| Route | When | Lands in |
|---|---|---|
| **Seller closing deliverable** | Payoff, release, satisfaction, termination or amendment is required | PSA deliverable list + condition precedent |
| **Survey order** | The item cannot be located, plotted or measured from the record | ALTA/NSPS scope letter |
| **Register item** | A term must be tracked across PSA drafts to closing | `DEAL-TERMS-REGISTER.md` — assign the next number |
| **Accepted exception** | ORA will take title subject to it | Title objection letter: expressly listed as accepted |
| **Counsel question** | Insurability, marketability, or multi-party consent mechanics | Named counsel, with the question written out |

Write the register rows in the register's own format so they can be pasted in directly, and never
renumber existing rows.

---

## STEP 5 — OUTPUT

A DOCX memo on ORA letterhead (ORA Institutional Style Guide v1.0+; 16-point QC gate before presenting),
naming `[DocType]_[Property]_[MMDDYYYY]` per the deal-file schema, containing:

1. **What is in hand and how old it is** — one line, first.
2. **Established** — vesting, parcel, legal description, restrictions of record.
3. **Must be cleared** — ranked by ability to move the closing date, cross-collateral first.
4. **Unknown** — with the order that would resolve each, and who is placing it.
5. **Register items** — ready to paste.
6. **Counsel questions** — written out.

Then state the two standing caveats: OCR-derived references are directional pending the commitment, and
nothing here is a legal opinion on marketability or insurability.

## CROSS-SKILL INTEGRATION

- `deal-execution` — Workflow 3 DD (Title & Survey category) consumes this output; findings become closing deliverables there.
- `loi-generation` / `deal-execution` — the `DEAL-TERMS-REGISTER.md` is the destination for tracked items.
- `lease-abstraction-pipeline` — landlord-of-record on each lease must match vesting here; a mismatch is a finding in both.
- `estoppel-request-generation` — SNDA and subordination requirements discovered here drive estoppel and SNDA scope.
- `ora-flood-zoning-dd` — zoning verification and flood determination; PD/PUD conditions found here route there.
- `acquisition-underwriting` — tax and assessment findings feed the carrying-cost build.

## Changelog

- v1.0 (2026-08-21): initial. Built after the 754 Old State Route 74 file review surfaced an open mortgage, a recorded assignment of rents, and a cross-collateral / cross-default package against the parcel — none of which appeared in the deal-terms register or the DD tracker after four months — and after the folder's only survey turned out to be a 2016 mortgage location survey that expressly disclaims boundary and title research while being relied on as if it were a boundary survey.
